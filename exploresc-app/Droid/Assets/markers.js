He came with only 25 cents in his pocket and skills that he aquired from the mills, in which he had worked, in Germany. To strengthen his knowledge and mechancial aptitude, he did extensive reading on all books involving engineering and machinery. Once in America, he joined with other Germans along the Little Salkehatchie River on the Moccasin Branch where he operated a farm and sawmill. A waterwheel fed by water from the dam, which they built and still standing today, powered the sawmill. After a fire destroyed the mill in 1860, he moved his family to the present site of Ehrhardt. Conrad was a very industrious young man. Without a water source, he built a boiler to power his new sawmill by steam. The mill proved to be very successful and it wasn't long before others flocked to Ehrhardt. As others arrived, Conrad saw the need for other services and built other businesses to meet the people's needs. Besides the sawmill, he built a planing mill, flour and gristmill, rice mill, cotton gin, buckle plant ( for horse harnesses ), and a general store which also served as the first post office in 1876, and subsequently, the first train depot. Now that his sons were older they could manage other businesses. Conrad then proceeded to convince the Atlantic Coast Line to build a railroad spur from Greenpond to Ehrhardt.<br><br>\nWith the completion of the railroad, Conrad began selling housing lots in the town and the town was incorporated in 1898. The incorporation set the tide for more businesses to come and Ehrhardt grew to over 1000 people by 1900. He was also a man with high Christian standards and a very generous person. He lived and practiced the standards of his own expressed words.  \"Try to owe no man anything but goodwill and endervor to pay that to all.\" It was this goodwill that led him to make a covenant with God as he was traveling to America, to build a church in the area he settled with his prosperity. He donated 2 acres for the Ehrhardt Memorial Lutheran Church and retired its outstanding debt when it was completed in 1904. He built a 10,000 gallon water tower sixty feet high to provide water for town residents for a small fee. And finally, he donated land to the town of Ehrhardt for the use as a cemetery, to which, he became its 1st occupant on September 13, 1908. Subsequent to his death, a 2nd railroad line, The BE&W, was started to provide transportation between Ehrhardt, Bamberg, and Walterboro (never finished) for the workers and merchants to do business with Ehrhardt. Ehrhardt provided significant shipments by rail of lumber products, as well as, growing agricultural & fertilizer products.

After considering law, he chose a degree in Civil Engineering in 1885. He set out as a railroad engineer, but soon contracted typhoid fever. He was at home in Anderson recuperating when in 1889 the city hired him to build an electric plant and system for running water. He completed a steam engine in 1890, as a source for electricity, but his attention soon turned to hydropower as a more cost effective alternative. Whitner sought the advice of Nicola Tesla, famous for his work with (and later against) Thomas Edison and the invention of the alternating current motor. Whitner returned to Anderson in 1894 with designs for an AC-driven hydropower plant in hand. Less than a year later, the High Shoals Experiment succeeded and Whitner collected investors for the much larger Portman Shoals Hydroelectric Station on the Seneca River, completed in 1897. That plant transmitted electricity 11 miles, the longest line in the United States at that time. It was this harnessing of \"white fire\" and its delivery which caused Anderson to be called \"The Electric City\" -- applicable then, as applicable today!<br><br>\nWhitner would later marry Katherine Roddey of Rock Hill and partner with Dr. Gill Wylie to form the Catawba River Company, forerunner of Duke Power.

Keeping up with the engineering achievements of the day, William Church Whitner became convinced that the long distance transmission of electric energy using hydropower would be developed in Anderson. On May 1, 1895, a group of Anderson's business and community leaders ventured to McFall's Mill at High Shoals on the Rocky River to witness history or to watch Whitner's folly, whichever the case. W.C. Whitner, chief engineer of the Anderson Water, Light, and Power Company, had rented space in McGill's grist and flour mill to install an experimental 5,000 volt alternating current generator to attempt to generate and transmit electric power 6 miles from there to the water system pumps at the Tribble Street power and water yard in Anderson. <b>It Worked!<\/b> This was the first successful long distance transmission of electricity in the South.\n<br><br>\nBased upon this success, Mr. Whitner was able to secure the financial backing to construct a larger dam and power plant at Portman Shoals on the Seneca River, 11 miles west of this spot. At Portman Shoals, the Anderson Water, Light, and Power Company built a 10,000 volt generator facility. When it was placed in service on November 1, 1897, the Portman Shoals Power Plant was the first hydroelectric facility to generate high voltage power without step-up transformers in the nation and perhaps in the world. These generators served not only the Anderson water system, the city street lights, other commercial interests and private homes, but more importantly, Anderson Cotton Mill, the first cotton mill in the South to be operated by electricity transmitted over long distance lines. The course of industrial development in the South was forever changed. Due to its \"unlimited\" supply of electric power, <i>The Charleston News and Courier<\/i> dubbed Anderson \"The Electric City\" in 1895.\n<br><br>\n<i>[Reverse, Leftmost Marker]<\/i>:<br> This generator, manufactured by Westinghouse Electric Company on March 28, 1911, was one of 5 similar units still in service at the Portman Shoals Power Plant on December 9, 1960, when the plant was shut down for the final time due to impending flooding by the waters of Lake Hartwell. It was displayed for many years at the Coleman Recreation Center on Murray Avenue. This is an Alternating Current Generator that produced 1,390 KVA at 2,300 volts and 303 amps per terminal. It generated 2 phase, 60 cycle power and operated at 225 rpm. While the original generators at Portman Shoals were destroyed by flooding due to dam breaks and electric fires that plagued the plant in its first years, this generator was nonetheless manufactured at a time when electric power generation was in its infancy.<br><br>\n<i>[Reverse, Rightmost Marker]<\/i>: Building upon his early success in Anderson, William Church Whitner developed hydroelectric power generating stations for a number of communities throughout the South, including Columbus, Griffin, and Elberton, Georgia. One of his earliest employees was a young Citadel engineering graduate named William States Lee. At the Catawba River in York County, South Carolina, he partnered with Dr. W. Gill Wylie. The Catawba Plant experienced financial difficulties and Mr. Whitner was offered and accepted a job with Virginia Railway and Power Company in Richmond, Virginia. Dr. Wylie later found funding to complete the Catawba project, using Whitner's original design, in one of his patients, James B. Duke, who was interested in investing in this new idea of long distance transmission of hydroelectric power. Of course, the history of Duke Energy Corporation and the role played by W.S.

The Palmetto tree was added to the flag later after the tree figured prominently on the battle of Fort Moultrie on June 28, 1776. When the people of Charleston heard that the British planned to capture Sullivan's Island, Colonel Moultrie and others built a fort of Palmetto logs on the island.

An Executive Order of President Eisenhower on that date provided for the arrangement of the stars in nine staggered horizontal rows and eleven staggered columns. This, the 27th flag of the United States, became the official flag on July 4th, 1960.<\/div>"},{"latlng":[34.847216,-82.400379],"options":{"title":"Guilford Courthouse Flag"},"popup":"<h1>Guilford Courthouse Flag<\/h1><strong>On South Main Street, Greenville, (On the left when traveling south)<\/strong><div><br>\nThis flag, often referred to as the Guilford Courthouse Flag, is an example of the diversity of American flags during the Revolutionary War period.

In the late 1700s traders gave the town its unusual name because they mistakenly believed this was the estimated number of miles to the Cherokee village of Keowee in the upper South Carolina foothills.\n<br><br>\nBy the mid-1700s European colonists found the town a favorable place to settle in spite of increasing troubles with local Indians. In 1760 Cherokees twice attacked Fort Ninety Six, built for the settlers' protection. Located at the crossroads of twelve roads and paths, Ninety Six village reached its peak in the 1770s. This important backcountry town boasted a growing population. 12 houses, taverns, shops, and a newly constructed courthouse and jail.\n<br><br>\nNinety Six also figured prominently in the Southern Campaign of the American Revolution. The first land battle south of New England was fought here in 1775, and in 1780 the British fortified this strategically important frontier town. From May 22-June 18, 1871, Major General Nathanael Greene, with 1,000 patriot troops, staged the longest siege of the Revolutionary War against 550 British loyalists who were defending Ninety Six. The earthen Star Fort remains as a well-preserved example of an original 18th century fortification.\n<br><br>\n<b>Park Information<\/b><br>\nThe park is located on Highway 248, two miles south of the town of Ninety Six. The visitor  features a museum with dozens of artifacts and exhibits. A 10-minute orientation video is available upon request. Books and souvenirs may be purchased at the gift shop. A one-mile walking trail allows visitors to explore historic roadbeds, reconstructed siegeworks, the original Star Fort, the reconstructed Stockade Fort, and much more. The site covers just over 989 acres. Because of its importance to the founding of our nation, Ninety Six National Historic Site became part of the National Park Service in 1976.\n<br><br>\n<b>Revolutionary War Encampment<\/b><br>\nThroughout the year, Ninety Six National Historic Site offers a variety of educational programming including reenactments from the Revolutionary era.\n<br><br>\n<b>The Star Fort<\/b><br>\nThe fort was constructed with slave labor under the direction of British engineers in 1780. It was constructed according to 18th century standards for earthen fortifications of that type. Being the strongest part of the British fortifications at Ninety Six, it successfully underwent a 28-day siege by the American Patriot army under the command of Major General Nathanael Greene. It stands today as one of the best preserved British fortifications from the Revolutionary War.\n<br><br>\n<b>The Siege of Ninety Six<\/b><br>\nArtist Robert Wilson created this depiction of the crescendo of the 28-day siege when, at noon on June 18, 1781, fifty American Patriots stormed the wall of the Star Fort. It captures the intensity of the struggle from the perspective of both sides.\n<br><br>\n<><b>Greenwood County<\/b><>\n<b>A Richly Diverse and Historical County<\/b><br>\nKnown today for its diverse business economy, Greenwood County has a rich historical heritage.

Wagons and carts pulled by horses or ozen were piled high with sacks of flour, bolts of cloth, and kegs of gunpowder. They clattered by on the unpaved surface. The uneven road was probably mired in mind or swirling in dust, depending on the season.

That was changed with the Revolutionary War.\n<br><br>\nIn Charleston, Patriot supporters formed an independent government and on September 15, 1775, the royal governor of the South Carolina colony fled to a British warship in Charleston Harbor, leaving the colony in the hands of the Americans. Confused and concerned by these events, backcountry residents split between those remaining loyal to the King and those siding with the Patriots. In Ninety Six, William Henry Drayton, a representative from the new government, successfully converted the townspeople to the Patriot cause, fortified the jail, and sent militias out to contain the Loyalist threat.

It rests on land previously owned by Gold Mine \"Billy\" Dorn and Cyrus McCormick, inventor of the reaper.\n<br><br>\nCyrus McCormick influenced the location of the railroad and in 1881 donated 40 acres of land for a town. By 1883, this town had a population of 200 people, and cotton gins and shipping were the major economic activities. In 1898, the McCormick's conveyed this portion of land to the railroad for construction of a steam-powered cotton seed oil mill and cotton gin.\n<br><br>\nAfter the invention of the cotton gin in 1793, the south became dependent on the one-crop economy of cotton. With the developing railroad system, which allowed more cotton to reach the marketplace, and introduction of textile manufacturing in the 1880s, the economy continued to be dominated by the growth, milling, and shipping of cotton products. Cottonseed, a byproduct of the ginning process, was viewed as having little value other than feed for livestock.\n<br><br>\n<b>Plant Modernization<\/b><br>\nBy the time of the mill's transformation into a highly engineered plant utilizing steam power, the energy saving methods pioneered by Oliver Evans (1795) were widely implemented. Corn and wheat moved by cups and belts (vertically) and screw conveyors (horizontally) through the milling process. The plant only required two employees, one to power the boilers and engines and the second the run the mill. The related lumberyard (owned by M.G. and J.J. Dorn) across the tracks to the northeast continued to provide sawdust\/shavings as fuel for the steam plants. When the milling production ceased in the 1940s, the steam engines powered the cotton gin into the 1950s.\n<br><br>\n<b>Loss of Productivity<\/b><br>\nPlanters continued to meet the industrial demands and paid little attention to land conservation practices which reduced the natural productivity of the soil. In 1919 the boil weevil introduced yet another disastrous problem.\n<br><br>\n<b>Diversification<\/b><br>\nIn response to the destruction of the main money crop, farmers finally made efforts towards crop diversification and livestock production.

Four years later, Cyrus purchased the Dorn Milling Company and 1,200 acres of land. To increase the profitability of the mines, McCormick used his influence to secure railroad connections to Augusta, GA and Greenwood SC.\n<br><br>\nThrough his generosity, land was donated for construction of two churches and a school. By 1880, the settlement had a population of 200 and shortly thereafter Cyrus donated 40 acres to establish a town. The people of Dorn's Gold Mines chose to name their town \"McCormick\" for its benefactors, Cyrus and Nettie F. McCormick. The town was chartered in December 1882 with three unique features. It was (1) build over gold mine tunnels; (2) planned; and (3) the first village incorporated as a \"dry\" town in SC, prohibiting the sale of \"spirituous or intoxicating\" drink for 100 years.\n<br><br>\nMcCormick, the county seat, declined when the agricultural economy was affected by the boil weevil, soil erosion, and the depression of the 1930s.

The ease of railroad shipping resulted in the rapid growth of cottonseed oil production.

He then decided to advertise his seeds for sale in <i>The Rural American<\/i> at a cost of $3.50&#8212;and it brought him $6.50 in seed orders! He then saved up $10.00, bought a hand press and in 1868 printed his own 8-page catalog in his mother\u2019s parlor&#8212;and the George W. Park Seed Company was born!\n<br><br>\nAlthough founded in Libonia, Pennsylvania, Park Seed had called Greenwood, S.C. home for more than 80 years. How did this change of location come about? You could say that love had a hand in it. At the age of 64, George W. Park met the much younger Mary Barratt, a home demonstration agent from Greenwood, South Carolina. She had written to him for advice on teaching horticulture to homemakers. For 2 years they corresponded and what began as friendship based on their common horticultural interests blossomed into love. They were married in 1918. A few years later, Park moved the company to Mary\u2019s hometown&#8212;Greenwood.\n<br><br>\n<b>Wayside Gardens<\/b><br>\nIn 1975, Park Seed purchased Wayside Gardens of Mentor, Ohio and moved its offices here to the Park facility. Early in its history, Wayside became the most respected mail order nursery in the U.S. and the Park family has successfully continued and built on its tradition of excellence. Waysides horticulturists strive to find only the finest quality perennials, trees, and shrubs and travel the world in search of new and unusual garden treasures.\n<br><br>\n<b>Seeds in Space Program<\/b><br>\nIn a joint effort, Park Seed Company and NASA developed the SEEDS (Space-Exposed Experiment Developed for Students) program to study what effect the radiation-bombarded environment of space would have on different types of seeds. 14.5 million seeds from Parks were sent into space for almost six years. Upon their return to earth in 1991, the seeds were given to an estimated 4 million students and researchers in the United States plus 30 foreign countries. Data collected from the students and researchers, after growing out and testing the seeds, showed that the plants have very few significant effects from prolonged exposure to outer space. This conclusion has far-reaching implications for future space travel, including the feasibility of life-support systems in outer space. And, most importantly, millions of school children, some perhaps the scientists of the future, were able to participate in this unique hands-on science experiment.\n<br><br>\n<b>Flower Day<\/b><br>\nEach June, Park's invites visitors to its annual open house, or Flower Day, to see the gardens at their peak, tour the facilities, and take home plants and seeds, as well as ideas, for their own gardens.\n<br><br>\n<b>All-American Selections (AAS)<\/b><br>\nPark Seed has been an official AAS trial site for more than 50 years by growing and evaluating the award candidates in our trials alongside their nearest competitions already on the market.

He was commanding the 2d battalion, 8th Infantry, in an attack through the Hurtgen Forest near Schevenhutte, Germany, on 20 November 1944. During the early phases of the assault, the leading elements of his battalion were halted by a minefield and immobilized by heavy hostile fire. Advancing along into the mined area, Colonel Mabry established a safe route of passage. He then moved ahead of the foremost scouts, personally leading the attack, until confronted by a boobytrapped double concerina obstacle. With the assistance of the scouts, he disconnected the explosives and cut a path through the wire. Upon moving through the opening, he observed three enemy in foxholes whom he captured at bayonet point. Driving steadily forward he paced the assault against three log bunkers which housed mutually supported automatic weapons. Racing up a slope ahead of his men, he found the initial bunker deserted, then pushed on to the second where he was suddenly confronted by nine onrushing enemy. Using the butt of his rifle, he felled one adversary and bayoneted a second, before his scouts came to his aid and assisted him in overcoming the others in hand-to-hand combat. Accompanied by the riflemen, he charged the third bunker under pointblank small-arms fire and led the way into the fortification from which he prodded six enemy at bayonet point. Following the consolidation of the area, he led his battalion across 300 yards of firesweep terrain to seize elevated ground upon which he established a defensive position which menaced the enemy on both flanks, and provided his regiment a firm foothold on the Cologne Plain. Colonel Mabry's superlative courage, daring, and leadership in an operation of major importance exemplify the finest characteristics of the military service.\n<br><br>\n<i>Right Plaque<\/i>\n<><b>In Memoriam<\/b><br>\nPresbyterian College Alumni<br>\nKilled in World War II and the Korean War<br>\nTo These Comrades Who Died Defending<br>\nAmerica's Eternal Freedoms<br>\nWe Humbly Dedicate this Building<br>\n<b>May They Rest in Peace<\/b>\n<br><br>\n<b>1941 World War II 1945<\/b><>\n<i>Left Column<\/i><br>\nWilliam S.

Greenville's Main Street is located at its shallow ford. Its shoals and falls have been a source of power and growth, fun, inspiration and love. Legend has it that a Cherokee brave threw himself over the falls because of unrequited love. The subject of at least five published poems and several noted paintings, the falls became the favorite trysting place for young lovers as well as a resort for visitors and families. Dams above and below the falls created pools where children swam in the summer and skated in the winter. Ministers performed baptisms in there and entrepreneurs established bath houses (with separate entrances for ladies and gents; towels and soap supplied for twenty-five cents) making use of the clear river water. Beginning in the late 1700's, water-powered industries clustered along the Reedy River: trading posts, grist and corn mills, a sawmill, an ironworks, the Gower, Cox and Markley Coach Factory, a paper-making factory and an armory. A century later, Greenvillians established textile and apparel mills along its banks. Regrettably, the Reedy began to suffer from the spoils of progress. But in the late 1960's, following years of neglect, Greenville began to turn its attention back toward its historic birthplace. Twenty-six acres around the Reedy River Falls were reclaimed and plans were put in place for an historic park. Seeds for Falls Park on the Reedy were planed long, long ago. Now it is in full bloom.

The extreme upper part of the canal was cut straight across level land, the greatest difficulty being the bed rock which was encountered. This was blasted out, some of it being used in canal construction. The rock is visible in places along the upper part of the canal bed often showing holes which were drilled by hand for blasting. In building the canal all trees and plant growth were removed and excavations were carried out by hand or with mules and drag lines. Stumps were removed with a variety of machines common at the time.

Over the course of the next two years, the man of CCC Camp F-1 worked to create Oconee State Park on land that had been farmed heavily for decades and was heavily eroded. as in other CCC sites around the country, the CCC recruits at Oconee used native materials and traditional local resources to create the many and varied structures that stand on the park today.\n<br><br>\n<b>Hydraulic Ram Pump<\/b><br>\nOne method of moving water in our early parks was the hydraulic ram pump. One has been installed in the creek bed to your left. Such pumps use the force of flowing water to raise water uphill, and were commonly used to provide water to homes and barns in mountainous areas before electric pumps became common after World War II. Developed in Western Europe in the late 1700's, ram pumps operate by arresting the downward flow of water as it drops through a small pipe. Note the pipe feeding th ram from the small dam farther upstream. The force created by suddenly stopping the flow forces a small percentage of the water up a vertical pipe in a considerable height. A self-operating and closing valve causes this process to be repeated up to sixty times a minute, providing a characteristic chugging sound. Such pumps are self operating and cal raise water over a dozen times the height of the fall necessary for the pump to operate.\n<br><br>\n<b>The Early Park Waterwheel<\/b><br>\nOne of the major needs of the CCC camp and of the growing park was the generation of needed power for the various tasks necessary in the construction and operation of the park. One method used was this waterwheel. The building housing the wheel is a replica of the original wheelhouse which still exists in a remote area of the park where it was once used to power a pump which transported drinking water to the camp. The wheel itself is the original one used by the CCC at Oconee.\n<br><br>\nThe original water wheel operated by taking advantage of the rugged terrain and one of the many streams of this mountainous area. As situated here, the wheel used flow from the lake which is carried by pipe into the small stone well at your far right. A wooden trough guides water to the top of the wheel, where the buckets are filled with water, downward and turns a shaft at the  of the wheel. The shaft passes through the wall of the building to a pump which moves water up the hill to the stone well. In the original system the the water was moved nearly a mile. Any number of machines such as saws and pumps could be powered off the shaft by means of belts and gears attached to the shaft itself. This type of power production dates to over a century before the time of Christ, and was commonly used throughout the Carolina upcountry for generations. The introduction of the steam engine around the turn of the twentieth century and the arrival of electricity to the Oconee area in the fall of 1941 made waterwheels obsolete for all but a few tasks, mainly powering grist mills. even this use has all but faded into memory today.\n<br><br>\n<b>Waterwheels<\/b><br>\nThere are several types of vertical waterwheels. The Oconee waterwheel is an overshot wheel. This type of wheel uses the advantage of gravity as water flows over the top of the wheel and the weight of the water is added to the force of the water flow to produce power. Often overshot wheels were used in the mountains because they are best suited to small streams with steep drops and limited flow. It is the more effective of the two types of wheels.\n<br><br>\nAnother common type of vertical waterwheel is the undershot wheel. An undershot wheel had paddles rather than buckets on its outer rim. The sheel is positiobed with the lower portion in a moving stream and is powered by the flow of the warer, and is far more sensitive to seanonal fluctuations in water flow than an overshot wheel.<\/div>"},{"latlng":[34.84611111,-83.070125],"options":{"title":"Oconee Station \/ Oconee County"},"popup":"<h1>Oconee Station \/ Oconee County<\/h1><strong>On Oconee Station Road, Walhalla, <\/strong><div><br>\n<b>Oconee Station<\/b><br>\n<i>The South Carolina Frontier Experience<\/i><br>\n<br>\n<b>Oconee station & the William Richards House<\/b><br>\nThis site was a frontier outpost and a meeting place between European American and Cherokees of this region during the late 1700s. The first building here, known as Oconee Station, was built as a garrisoned fort for armed troops and included a military blockhouse. Its initial purpose was to protect white settlers in the area from Indian attack. Soon Oconee Station became used as a trading post. Trader William Richards came to live on the property in 1795 and, in 1805, built a brick residence next to the station building.\n<br><br>\n<b>Military Outposts and Trade<\/b><br>\nThe sturdy stone structure at Oconee station housed as many as 30 soldiers at a time over a period of about eight years. We can only guess at the number of deerskins that passed through its doors during and since that time. Deerskin was in high demand in Europe, and Southwestern Indians responded by hunting millions of deer annually for trade. In exchange, they received weapons, cotton and linen fabrics, rum, ornaments, metal tools, and other items. European guns made it easier for Indians to hunt deer, but weapons were also valuable to them in defense against their enemies. Though trade was beneficial to both sides, it was disruptive of traditional Native American life, particularly as hunters. The Indians bartered other goods such as baskets, ginseng, and snakeroot, but deerskins remained their main trade good until Indian removal from the Southeast.\n<br><br>\n<b>Material Cultures<\/b><br>\nIn exchange for their valuable deerskin, many Southeastern Indians received clothing made of European cotton and other fabrics, wearing a mixture of European and traditional Indian apparel. The attire of the white Americans living on the frontier also showed a blending. The fringed deerskin jacket associated with the frontiersman is European in construction but Native American in its materials and decoration. The sharing of material cultures between European-Americans and Native Americans revealed the amount of contact between these two groups and symbolized the complexity of their relationships, which ranged from inflamed animosity to friendly cooperation.\n<br><br>\n<b>Defending the South Carolina Frontier<\/b><br>\nAs Europeans and European-American settlement expanded across South Carolina, the \"frontier\" moved west. Beginning in 1792, Oconee Station and six similar military outposts served as the westernmost defensive points for new settlers. Scouts based in these stations roamed the frontier areas and served as an early warning network of imminent Indian attacks, giving the alarm to local white settlers. This site was the only station on the South Carolina frontier that remained in operation after 1796. Its use by the military ended after 1799, when the threat of a major Indian attack became highly unlikely. Oconee Station, with its history as a military fort and trading post, reveals the complex and changing relationships between Southeastern Indians and white settlers, as the whites gained land and as the Indian Territory was pushed westward.\n<br><br>\n<b>Oconee County<\/b><br>\n<i>Through a Traveler's Eyes<\/i><br>\nIn May 1775 William Bartram, a British naturalist, crossed the Savannah River from Georgia and explored the Keowee River Valley in present-day Oconee and Pickens Counties.

In the mid-1820s, the congregation moved to Pendleton, which had developed into a gentrified village and was beginning its role in antebellum social life.\n<br><br>\n<b>The Cemetery<\/b><br>\nThe oldest part of the burial area slightly predates the church. Charles Miller, who died in the fall of 1795, was one of the early burials in the cemetery. Charles was the younger son of John Miller, who was the first newspaper publisher in the Carolina upcountry and a noted London newspaper publisher during the years of the American Revolution. Located on a corner of John Miller's land grant, the property would be deeded after 1800 to the congregation. Presbyterians associated with the Pendleton area, or with early families entombed there, dominate the oldest parts of the cemetery. During much of the twentieth century, the cemetery served the broader needs of a diverse community often connected with Clemson University.Although numbers of African-American slaves were members of the congregation, none are buried within the graveyard. Those individuals dying prior to 1865 (and sometime later) were interred in the slave cemeteries on the various nearby plantations.\n<br><br>\n<b>The Preservation of The Old Stone Church and Cemetery<\/b><br>\nBy the late 1800s, the cemetery was in need of restoration. Descendants of those buried there, as well as other interested persons, formed an association. In 1902, the Pendleton Presbyterian Church created a Commission to care for the property. Major repairs were made to the building in the second half of the twentieth century.<\/div>"},{"latlng":[34.22524,-81.05096],"options":{"title":"Fairfield Institute \/ Kelly Miller"},"popup":"<h1>Fairfield Institute \/ Kelly Miller<\/h1><strong>On Congress Street, Winnsboro, (On the right when traveling south)<\/strong><div><i>[Fairfield Institute Side]<\/i><br>\nThis grade school and normal institute for blacks was founded in 1869 during Reconstruction by the Northern Presbyterian Church.

The dream was to develop a railroad line from Charleston, South Carolina to Cincinnati, Ohio. The Blue Ridge Rail Line was completed from Charleston to Pendleton by the 1850s but the granite Stumphouse Mountain presented a major challenge.<br><br>\nFifteen hundred tunnel workers and their families made their home on Stumphouse Mountain in a town called Tunnel Hill. Most of the workers were Irish immigrants who were following their dreams to America. They worked twelve hour days, six days a week using only sledge hammers, hand drills, and black powder.<br><br>\nTunnel Hill was a rough town with more saloons than churches. In 1854, Father Jeremiah Joseph O'Connell came to Tunnel Hill. Dismayed by the lack of sobriety and the lawlessness he encountered, Father O'Connell worked to get the railroad company to agree to fire anyone that did not remain sober. He built a catholic Church dedicated to Saint Patrick and established a school for the education of the miner's children.<br><br>\nIn 1850, the German Colonization Society from Charleston organized the town of Walhalla, which is about 6 miles southeast of Stumphouse Mountain. The prospects of having major railroad line nearby brought much excitement about future economic opportunities. The Society's leader, John Andreas Wagener, filled a critical need for the railroad venture by constructing a black powder mill at the base of Issaqueena Falls.<br><br>\nStumphouse Tunnel was to be 5,863 feet long. Four shafts were to be completed to provide fresh air for the workers and allow them to work from both sides simultaneously. At its deepest level, the current tunnel was 236 feet below the highest point on the mountain. The granite stone was relentless and, at peak manpower, workers were able to progress only 200 feet per month. Work continued in spite of numerous problems including an unscrupulous construction company, high operating costs, and the inability to secure consistent funding.<br><br>\nWorkers were able to cut 1,600 feet from the western opening before state funds ran out in 1859. Before more money could be acquired, the War Between the States began. The town of Tunnel Hill faded away into history. After the war, South Carolina was in no position to continue construction of the rail line, thus the tunnel remains unfinished to this day.<br><br>\nThe temperature inside the tunnel is a consistent 56 degrees with 85% humidity year round. In the 1940s, Dr. Paul G. Miller of Clemson College realized that these conditions were ideal for curing blue cheese. After the process was perfected, the conditions of the tunnel were duplicated at the Clemson Agricultural Center, and the cheese making was moved to Clemson.<br><br>\nToday, Stumphouse Tunnel is one of the most visited historical sites in South Carolina. The Tunnel, along with Issaqueena Falls, is a recreational site operated by the City of Walhalla.<\/div>"},{"latlng":[33.55805556,-81.72],"options":{"title":"James F. Byrnes"},"popup":"<h1>James F.

When the county built the new airfield at its current location on Highway 24, this building was moved to the other side of the old airfield to an area near the old county stockade and used as offices for the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources.

Smythe, who was a trustee of Clemson College for a number of years, took ownership of Woodburn in 1881. At the time, most Upcountry farms grew cotton. Smythe's enterprise foreshadowed the agriculture future of the region, where the livestock farms and diverse crops of today have supplanted the cotton farms of the past.\n<br><br>\n<b>A Summer Get-Away<\/b><br>\nIn the early 1800s, many Lowcountry plantation owners left the summer heat and threat of malaria for the cooler climate of the foothills. This expensive home was designated to take advantage of this alluring climate. Design features of the home including high ceilings, cross ventilation, and wide columned piazzas on both stories at the front and rear. Lowcountry planter Charles Cotesworth Pinckney made Woodburn his summer home around 1830. In 1852 Woodburn was acquired by Dr. John Bailey Adger.

In 1966 Clemson college deeded Woodburn to the Pendleton Historic Foundation, which took on the formidable job of restoring the property.\n<br><br>\nSince the 1960s, Woodburn Historic House has been restored, refurnished, and revived.

The Morgan Mercantile Store was one of several in town that sprang up during this era to supply needed merchandise.\n<br><br>\nCentral's boom town period abruptly ended in 1897 when Southern Railway, which had taken over the rail service, moved their headquarters from Central to Greenville.

The project is designed as a peaking plant, with an installed capacity of 600 megawatts -- which makes it the largest Corps hydroelectric project in the southeast.

Millwood was a concentrated village allowing overseers to exercise control over 200 slaves, livestock, storage facilities and workshops. One of the first structures built was a gristmill and millrace, completed in 1834. Turbines for the mill were powered by water with a 14-foot drop.\n<br><br>\nExcavation of the site uncovered the foundation remains and debris from about 45 structures inhabited until 1889. In all, Millwood consisted of about 10,000 acres of land. Major crops were cotton and corn. After the decline of the cotton economy following the Civil War, Calhoun faced great financial losses. The concentrated population of tenants, overseers and slaves were dispersed to about one house per 30-40 acres. Numerous small fields replaced the large plantation ones, and a network of roads was built to maintain contacts. Calhoun managed to keep most of his land by renting to tenants and by leasing the use of water power and a gold mining operation. Following Calhoun's death in 1889, a board of trustees continued to rent and manage the estate. The main village became a locally popular \"resort' in the 20th century. Duke Power Company acquired the property in the 1940s to develop hydroelectric power. Upon learning of the plans for the Richard B.

Animals dependent on these wetlands include muskrats, river otters, turtles, frogs, water snakes, fish, dukes, geese, herons, and other birds.\n<br><br>\nA careful observer can also see other signs of beaver activity near the trails along the wetlands, such as stumps of beaver gnaw marks. the \"skeletons\" of dead trees in the wetlands indicate that the beaver dams have flooded former bottomland forests, drowning the tree roots and killing the trees.\n<br><br>\nBeavers live in mud and branch lodges located in or at the edge of their ponds. Lodge entrances are generally under water to provide protection from predators. Some beaver dams in the Park are hundreds of feet long and raise the pond level behind the dam as much as 3 feet. Like the lodges, the dams are constructed of sticks and small trees harvested by the beavers and bound solidly together with mud.\n<br><br>\nBeaver can grow to a length of approximately 4 feet, including their broad flat tails, and can weigh more than 50 lbs. Mating for life, both parents care for the one to four young (kits) that are born in the spring.

Named after the wife of King George III, Fort Charlotte was a British fort built in 1766. It was located on the South Carolina side of the Savannah River about one and one-half miles below the mount of the Broad River and the settlement of Vienna, where the river was shallow and about 660 feet wide.\n<br><br>\nOriginally garrisoned by British troops, the fort was abandoned in 1768 and turned over to the Colonial administration. Discussion ensured as to dismantle the fort or convert it for other public use. Another, fort, however, (Fort Prince George) was found to be unsafe and ordered to be abandoned with its ordinance stores, arms and ammunition sent to Fort Charlotte. This greatly increased the importance of Fort Charlotte, which was commanded by Capt. George Whitefield with 15 troops under his command. Consequently, the Council of Safety created by the Provincial Congress on June 1, ordered Major James Mayson to lead a Patriot force of two companies of Rangers, dispatched from Ninety Six, consisting of 53 men (Capt. John Caldwell and his company of 28 men, and Capt. Moses Kirkland and his company of 23 men) to seize the munitions at Fort Charlotte. Upon his arrival on July 12, 1775, the fort and all its possessions were peacefully surrendered to him by Capt. Whitefield, and subsequently placed under the command of Capt. John Caldwell and a company of 15 men. The seizure of Charlotte was the first overt act of the American Revolution in South Carolina.\n<br><br>\n<b>Third South Carolina Regiment (Rangers) 1775-1780<\/b><br>\nThe regiment was established by the South Carolina Provincial Congress in June 1775, as mounted riflemen who used horses for transportation but dismounted to fight on foot.

The regiment was placed on the Continental Establishment in September 1776 as mounted riflemen, and in October its complement increased to 600 men in 12 companies, with the commanding officer, the major, and the senior captain all being promoted one grade.\n<br><br>\nThe regiment was recruited in the backcountry and on the frontiers, and normally served in multi-company detachments, one of which took over Fort Charlotte in July 1775.

The morning of September 11, 2001, reminded me that there was a bigger world than my manufactured campus. I think it was the first time my generation was ever challenged to look beyond ourselves. Suddenly we had to face the reality of war and we were no longer invincible. It was a sobering beginning to college and it caused me to re-evaluate my views. I cannot say that where I am today connects directly to those events but I can say that 9\/11 and its aftermath drew me closer to my family and that the heroism displayed by a variety of \"ordinary\" individuals challenged me to seek opportunities in my own life to go beyond the easiest route. Eileen Gilbert\n<br><br>\nProverbs 17:17: \"A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.\" During the tough times and the traumatic events people rose up to the challenge and dared to help one another. We all became \"brothers\" through one unifying event. Dylan Rebillot\n<br><br>\nIt wasn't something I could really fathom. What did this mean? Was this the beginning of attacks that were going to happen all over the United States? Who did it? Were we going to war? Other than sorrow for the people who died, I didn't know what to think. Greta Thielen\n<br><br>\n9\/11 was tragic, but it connected every single person in this country in a meaningful way. It made us realize that we are vulnerable and that unity is essential to survival. Ryland Gore\n<br><br>\nI don't know any more today what the future will hold than I did then. Yet somehow I maintain the same calm. Justine Sittema\n<br><br>\nI remember returning from my first class of the year and getting in instant messenger only to see a message from my sister that said, 'If you haven't seen, turn on your TV right now!\" So I went down the hall and two or three girls from my hall were watching the disaster unfold. We all just stared at the TV not knowing what to do or say. This is one day I will always remember. It's like when I asked my parents what they were doing when they found out that Kennedy was assassinated and they responded, with explicit detail, exactly what they were doing. Betsy Fischer\n<br><br>\nI shall always remember my first day of class at Furman - September 11, 2001. It was not only the beginning of the most important phase of my life thus far, it was the one and only time in my life that I've witnessed people of all races, backgrounds and beliefs come together as one American family. It was the first time that people of this country and institution came together in one accord in memory of those who had lost their lives. Shunta Harmom\n<br><br>\n<i>[Right]<\/i>:<br>\nWe awoke knowing the day would be unique. Maybe even memorable - it was out first day as college students - but the true magnitude of the day remained unthinkable. I remember hearing the news. It seemed to surreal. As I wandered around campus, all TVs were on: students and faculty clamored around. Though I'd never experienced the \"average class day,\" I knew this day was unique. I attended my classes, but no recollections remain. I do, however, remember the weightiness I felt. As with any tragedy, there is great pain, but there is also hope. For the class of 2005, our career began with this tragedy, but after 4 years, we leave Furman stronger and more mature. We can arise courageous and strengthened. Sarah Pannell\n<br><br>\nSeptember 11, 2001, is the day our world changed forever. Two of the most visible icons of American strength and financial power, the Twin Towers in New York City, were reduced to a pile of rubble and death. The Pentagon, which is the nerve  of our military, was also struck on this tragic day. Americans learned that vast oceans no longer protect us from the dangers of a new era. McKenzie Miller\n<br><br>\nThe present moment is upon us. May you rest in this moment, loving deeply, risking greatly, and living fully. For tomorrow is a gift we have not yet been given. RBP\n<br><br>\nThrough the terrors of these attacks we realized our common bond. For one moment in time there were no whites or African-Americans. There were no Protestants or Catholics. Nobody cared if you were a Democrat or Republican, or even if you were heterosexual or homosexual. What mattered was that we were Americans...and this is the American that I will always love and cherish. Keith B. Johnson\n<br><br>\nThe red, white and blue waved at half-staff by the time I pulled into the parking lot of Duncan Chapel Fire Department to apply for volunteer service. It was not until a few months later, while running my first structure fire, that I understood, and today, I proudly hang my helmet. Matt Malone\n<br><br>\nIt was my first birthday away from home, and I wondered if anyone would know that it was my birthday. Suddenly, the broadcaster came on the radio and announced that the Twin Towers in New York City had been hit by airplanes and had fallen. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. All of a sudden, it didn't matter that it was my birthday, nor did it matter that I didn't know very many people here. Everything else was trivial compared to the news on the radio. Joseph Hill\n<br><br>\nIt seemed like I was watching a movie. It was really hard to believe what I was watching on TV was actually happening in real life. Jacqueline Bishop\n<br><br>\nOur first reaction was sadness. As the sadness wore off, anger took its place. I wondered why I was at Furman. I wondered why I did not go to West Point like my father did so I could fight back against the people that did this. Buckley Warden\n<br><br>\nIt's odd watching old movies now, because in day-to-day life I forget anything happened. But then you see the old New york skyline, and it makes you catch your breath - where there once were people and buildings is not just air. Mandi Carlton\n<br><br>\nMy mom told me that my sister had gone into labor and was in the hospital a couple of blocks from the Pentagon. When I heard that a plane had hit the Pentagon, I was stressed since my family was in the area, and I hoped and hoped that nothing more would happen. But it was so far removed from our current environment. So I was just kind of numb. I started to feel less numb when I heard that my sister had a boy and that they were safe.

Total food consumption is up to 200 pounds each day.\n<br><br>\nJoy, a female, weighs over 8,000 pounds and is just under 8 feet tall. Females are smaller than males, but not dainty.\n<br><br>\nIt's impolite to ask a lady her age, however, Joy was born in 1970 and has been a popular resident of the Greenville Zoo since 1977.\n<br><br>\nBecause \"elephant years\" are about the same as human years, you can expect to visit Joy for many years to come.\n<br><br>\nEach morning, Joy is bathed and her back and feet scrubbed thoroughly. During her morning bath, she is inspected carefully for anything out of the ordinary, her teeth are examined and the condition of each foot is reviewed closely.\n<br><br>\nAn elephant's feet must be kept in very good condition at all times. They put a lot of weight on their feet and can't just sit back and put their feet up as we do. A cut or scrape or any cracking of the skin on the pads of their feet could easily result in lameness or worse, a life threatening infection. In addition to the daily inspection and cleaning of her feet, the pads of her feet are trimmed regularly as are her toenails. Yet, she does have her nails done regularly.\n<br><br>\n<><b>In the Wild!<\/b><>\nElephants eat just about any kind of plant material; grasses, flowers, fruit, and even known down trees for leaves and bark. They may consume up to 350 pounds of food a day, depending on the quality.\n<br><br>\nMales, the largest living land animals, can weigh over 12,000 pounds and reach a height of more than 12 feet.\n<br><br>\nElephants live 60 to 70 years. A \"natural\" cause of death for old elephants is worn out teeth. They have four very large molars or grinding teeth. As they wear out, they are replaced, but only six times throughout their life. When the last molars wear out, they can no longer grind their food, ultimately starving.\n<br><br>\nElephants live in herds of 6 to 12 animals, sometimes more. The herd is led by the matriarch, usually the oldest, most experienced female, and includes her daughters and their offspring, but no adult males. They mare at about 15 years of age. Pregnancy last 22 months; the single calf weights about 250 pounds at birth and nurses for two years. Mothers, grandmothers, sisters and aunts all help raise babies. Male calves leave the herd as they reach puberty.\n<br><br>\nAdult males live alone or in \"breeder bands.\" When a male is reach to breed, he approaches the matriarch-led herd, signaling his intentions. When done, he rejoins the \"bachelor band\" or goes off on his own.\n<br><br>\n<><b>Are They Endangered?<\/b><>\nThere are two species of elephants, the African and the Asian, <i>Elephas maximus<\/i>. The Asian elephant is endangered, with only 30,000 to 40,000 remaining in the wild. African elephants are threatened, a step away from endangered, with about 600,000 remaining, down from 1.5 million in 1978. Their rapid decline was due to the loss of habitation and to the illegal killing of elephants for their ivory tusks. A world-wide ban on the trade in ivory has greatly reduced, but not eliminated the numbers killed for their tusks.\n<br><br>\nHabitat loss occurs when human population and activities increase and the elephant's territory is broken into smaller and smaller pieces, leaving them without enough space to live and eat.\n<br><br>\nWhen protected, as in a national park, elephants thrive and the herds grow. But, if the growth is not controlled, they will eat themselves out of house and home. In the past, excess animals were shot or died of starvation. Now, birth control is being viewed as a solution. Elephants in Kruger National Park, South Africa have been inoculated with a birth control vaccine. The Greenville Zoo was one of two zoos that participated in a program to test the vaccine. Now, her wild relatives may have a better life because of the research that involved Joy.<\/div>"},{"latlng":[34.18888889,-82.16058889],"options":{"title":"Municipal Fountain"},"popup":"<h1>Municipal Fountain<\/h1><strong>On Long Street, Greenwood, (On the right when traveling north)<\/strong><div><>Sponsored by<br>\nthe Greenwood Beautification<br>\nCommission with contributions<br>\nfrom individual, businesses,<br>\ncivic groups and city funds<br>\n----------<br>\nDedicated September 18, 1864<br>\n----------<br>\nBeautification Commission<br>\nMrs. George A.

From its foundation until 1956, Clemson was an all-military college, one of seven in the nation. The student body was organized as a Corps of Cadets under a regular army Commandant. All students wore uniforms, attended military classes, practiced military drills, lived in barracks, marched to meals in a common mess hall, and most attended military summer camp at a US Army post - all the while working towards a college degree in their chosen field. Most were commissioned as officers in the US Army Reserve Corps on graduation, and many saw active duty with the military in foreign wars. During those sixty years, 12,314 students graduated, nearly 10,000 became Reserve Officers, about 5,600 saw active military service, and 335 died or were missing in action while fighting for their country.\n<br><br>\nLife as a cadet was far different from that of present-day students at Clemson. The purpose of this garden is to portray and explain the customers and traditions that were unique to cadet life.\n<br><br>\n<b>The Guardroom and Guardroom Bell<\/b><br>\nAtop old No. 1 Barracks, high above the Guardroom three floors below, the Guardroom Bell was at the very  of cadet life. The Guardroom was always manned by cadets assigned by the top cadet officers: two \"rats\" (freshmen) for running errands, the Corporal of the Guard (a sophomore), th Officer of the Guard and Officer of the Day (seniors). Their duties were to answer the only barracks telephone and to relay messages to cadets, to provide visitors with information and help, to maintain order, to ensure that the bugler sounded his calls on time, and to ring the Guardroom Bell for all formations and for the first class of the day.\n<br><br>\nAll campus life marched to the tune of the Guardroom Bell, the same bell you see here.

The encampment included the terrain where historic McCant's Middle School now stands, continuing to the corner of Fant and River Streets.

They were joined by other fellow Carolina patriots as well, including soldiers who later became Pickens County citizens.\n<br><br>\nThe victory of Generals Morgan and Pickens over British Commander Tarleton at Cowpens in January 17, 1781 following the Battle of Kings Mountain on October 7, 1780, effectively broke the back of the British offensive in the Carolinas and contributed greatly to the surrender of Cornwallis to General George Washington at Yorktown on October 18, 1781.\n<br><br>\nLikewise, in skirmishes with the Cherokee in the years just prior to, during and after the Revolution, the skillful battle tactics and utter lack of fear on the part of General Pickens, contributed to victory over the Indians when pressures of new settler encroachment erupted into open conflict.\n<br><br>\nAndrew Pickens was born on September 19, 1739 in Pennsylvania and immigrated with his family as a young man in the mid-1700s to the emerging frontier of upper South Carolina, where they settled eventually in the Long Cane area of Abbeville County. He married Rebecca Fluoride Calhoun, whose family had moved there from Virginia, and they began to rear their family.\n<br><br>\nDuring those dangerous years frontier settlements endured attacks from Indians and from Tories and the British as well. Their dwellings were plundered and Mrs. Pickens on many occasions had to abandon their home and secrete herself and children for days while her husband was away fighting. They had six daughters and three sons, one of which would become governor of South Carolina as also did a grandson.\n<br><br>\nGeneral Pickens and his wife were very devout Presbyterians and were instrumental in building the Old Stone Church \"Meeting House\" near Clemson. This church was near land General Pickens acquired on the Seneca River containing 575 acres in 1784 which he named \"Hopewell.\" At Hopewell a year later he negotiated the final peace treaty with the Cherokee Indians during several days of meetings under the famous \"Treaty Oak\" on a high spot above what is now Lake Hartwell. This is today just south of and within earshot of the Clemson Golf Course and Madren Center.\n<br><br>\nIn addition to his military accomplishment, Andrew Pickens honorable served his state in important civil capacities as well. Following the Revolution, he was elected to the House of Representatives from Ninety Six District for the terms 1778-1780, 1781-1784, and 1786-1788. He served as the senator from Pendleton District in 1780-1793.\n<br><br>\nHe was elected to the 3rd Congress of the United States, and served in that capacity from March 4, 1795-March 13, 1795. He was also a member of the Constitutional Convention of 1790.\n<br><br>\nHe represented Pendleton District in the House of Representatives in the years 1798-1800 and 1812-1814. He declined a nomination for Governor of South Carolina.\n<br><br>\nIn late life he built a new home at Tamassee he called \"The Red House\" on a hilltop overlooking the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains. Here he lived until August 11, 1817. when, full of years, he died peacefully, sustained by his simple faith and passed into the waiting arms of his savior for eternity. His burial, and that of his beloved wife, Rebecca, was at Old Stone Church, Clemson.\n<br><br>\nThe people of this area, revering the name of Andrew Pickens, for his distinguished service in war and peace, honored his memory when the new district was formed in 1828 by denoting it \"Pickens District.\" When it was divided in 1868, the people of the newly-formed county to the east of the Keowee, continued to honor his memory with our new County being named for him.<\/div>"},{"latlng":[34.88277778,-82.70666667],"options":{"title":"Pickens County Buffalo Soldiers"},"popup":"<h1>Pickens County Buffalo Soldiers<\/h1><strong>Near Pendleton Street, Pickens, <\/strong><div><><b>Private Major Terrell, United States Army<br>\nFirst Pickens County Casualty of World War One<\/b><>\nA resident of Hurricane Township in Pickens, Major Terrell joined the U.S. Army in October 1917 and was assigned to the 305th Labor Company, Quartermaster Corps.

This cabin is a \"five-log'er,\" requiring only five logs, averaging 18 inches high to go from floor to ceiling.\n<br><br>\nBy the mid-1900's, with the roof falling inn, the structure suffered from neglect and was in danger of disappearing forever. In 1960, thirteen-year-old Billy Davis of Pickens, talked then owner, attorney W.E. Findley, into selling him the logs for his life savings of $60.00. With the help of his father, Harold Davis, and his grandfather, J.J. Hedden, young Billy was able to see the old cabin reconstructed in back of the Davis home, at that time next to Cannon Hospital in Pickens. For many years, the David family gave tours of the old cabin and even saw it filed for a Randy Travis video when Gormillion Studios was contemplating moving to Pickens County.\n<br><br>\nIn 2001, the property was sold and the cabin was auctioned off. Dr. Larry Brotherton, of Easley, purchased the cabin and to keep it from being taken outside Pickens County he stored the logs at his Easley business.

Evidence of these early \n\nhunters and gatherers has been found in Beaufort County, but presently, there is little confirmed evidence for \n\nPaleoindian occupation of Parris Island.<br>\nTraditional views suggest these people depended heavily upon megafauna- large game which is now extinct. More \n\nrecent studies suggest those living in the southeast may have had a more diverse subsistence strategy, with greater use \n\nof other resources than large game.<br>\n<b>Archaic Period<\/b><br>\n8,000 to 1,100 BC <br>\nFrequent occupation of Parris Island began about 4,000 years ago, during the Archaic Period. Archaic peoples depended \n\nless on big game and more on a broad- based hunting, fishing and gathering system. The rich marsh environment here \n\nplayed an important role in the choice of seasonal movement.<br>\nGreater subsistence diversity allowed an increase in population density and a less nomadic lifestyle. The long term use \n\nof village sites, or seasonal reuse over long spans of time, resulted in deep shell rings and middens.<br>\nAmong more notable innovations of the Archaic is the appearance of pottery. Sherds of these vessels, among the \n\nearliest yet identified in North America, date to about 2,500 to 1,500 BC, and are fairly common on Parris Island. <br>\n<b> Woodland Period <\/b><br>\n1,100 BC to AD 1200 <br>\nWhen the Woodland period began, little had changed from the Late Archaic. People still depended upon a broad-based \n\nhunting, fishing, and gathering system, and lived in much the same way as their ancestors.<br>\nAbout AD 600, the appearance of the bow and arrow signaled many changes in the prehistoric Southeast. These more \n\nefficient weapons, combined with an increasing reliance on corn, beans, and squash by AD 1000, allowed people to live in \n\nmore permanent settlements than ever before.<br>\nBy the Late Woodland palisaded villages appeared in some areas. This may reflect increased conflict as centralized \n\npopulations came into contact with other groups competing for the same resources, and also now armed with the more \n\neffective bow and arrow.<br>\n<b>South Appalachian Mississippian Period <\/b><br>\nAD 1200 to contact <br>\nBeginning about the year 1200, the most socially complex societies in pre-European South Carolina came into \n\nmaturity.<br>\nSettlers became fairly permanent and territorial control was vigorously defended. Intertribal conflict from this meant \n\npalisaded villages remained common early in this period. By about AD 1300, this culminated in a social breakdown and \n\nsome larger sites were abandoned. As the population dispersed, smaller villages took their place.<br>\nSubsistence remained a diverse mix of hunting, fishing, gathering and agriculture. In the Lowcountry, shellfish remained \n\na staple of the diet, but maize, beans, and squash were cultivated and remained important.<br>\nThe end of the South Appalachian Mississippian closed with the arrival of Europeans, heralding a new, often tumultuous, \n\nera of Native American history.<\/div>"},{"latlng":[32.350528,-80.682049],"options":{"title":"Uncommon Valor"},"popup":"<h1>Uncommon Valor<\/h1><strong>On Blvd. deFrance, Parris Island, (On the left when traveling east)<\/strong><div><>\n\"Uncommon Valor Was A Common Virtue\" <br>\nMt.

Following in his father's footsteps, who was a self taught dentist and 2nd lieutenant in the Confederate Army, James graduated from Medical College of Charleston in 1887 after graduating from the Citadel in 1883. After beginning his practice in the Allendale area of Barnwell County, he decided to relocate to the booming town of Ehrhardt after his 1st wife, Laura Barber Roberts had died with their 2nd child. He purchased a large farm tract with her inheritance and processed lumber from the farm to build this house on a separate parcel of 3&#189; acres.The large support beams were made from pine and exterior siding, from cypress. It has 6 bedrooms with private bathrooms, as well as, formal living room, formal dining room, large kitchen, and 2 guest &#189; bath. James and his 2nd wife, Laura Furman Roberts, occupied the house with their 6 children. Dr. Roberts used the front downstairs bedroom for his medical office and treatment room. If one of his patients required overnight attention, they used the upstairs bedrooms. The wrap-around porch became the waiting area. Having been very well received in Ehrhardt, James persuaded his brother, Robert, to build the house across the street , which was completed in 1908. Subsequently, he donated the land next to it, to the Methodist Church, which named the church, St. James Methodist Church, in his honor. James became very active in the town's leadership, church leadership, and businesses. He opened a pharmacy on the main street. Later, he became the first person to sell house lots to African-Americans. Consequently, the southern suburbs of Ehrhardt are often referred to as Robertsville.

Highly touted as a responsible construction choice, using recycled tires with a project like this doesn't just provide drainage; it also keeps tires out of landfills. The tires used in this project were collected from Anderson County residents at the White Street Convenience Center and shredded by Shred Tire, Inc., a Trenton, South Carolina company dedicated to turning waste tires into reusable forms such as landscaping mulch, drainage fill, playground cover, and potting soil additive. Recycled tires, in various forms, provide crucial structural support for this project. Crumb rubber, a product of recycled tires, comes as very small, pebbled-like pieces and almost granular in texture and allows water to trickle through its thickness instead of retaining that moisture, thereby avoiding a buildup of water pressure that can damage structures. The backfill needed for the large retaining wall for the pond and the smaller retaining wall for the wall near the northeastern restrooms was created from crumb rubber. Additionally, all of the underlayment for the walking trails in and around the facility were built using crumb rubber. It also provides the drainage needed by the newly applied sod that was installed in the areas of the amphitheater. Shredded tires, usually in large pieces up to three feet in length, offer greater drainage than that of crumb rubber. In this facility, it allows water to seep through the layers under the base of the pond, under the concrete stage slab, and in the French drain system of the artificial creek. Approximately 85 tons of crumb rubber and 135 cubic yards of shredded tires were utilizes in the construction of the Sports and Entertainment Center.

From about 6,000 BC to 500 AD, these stone age people traveled throughout the southeast staying along the coast for only part of the year. Starting around 500 AD, they began to settle along the coast in semi-permanent communities. The American Indians lived by gathering food, hunting game, fishing, harvesting shellfish and some subsistence farming. Then, in the sixteenth century their simple lifestyle was totally disrupted by the arrival of Europeans looking for riches, slaves and settlement sites.<><br>\n<b>Arrival of the Europeans<\/b><>Parris Island and Port Royal Harbor have long been associated with the European settlement of North America. Twenty-two years after Columbus made his first landfall in the Caribbean, Spanish seafarers were exploring the southeastern coast. The Spanish called the region Florida and in 1521, Spanish vessels entered the sound off Parris Island and captured Indian slaves. In 1526 the Spanish named the region around Parris Island Santa Elena (St. Helena). Later that year a settlement attempt failed and the Spanish ceased the colonial ventures in the southeast until the 1560's when French incursions drew the back to Santa Elena.<><br>\n<b>Charlesfort<\/b><> The threat to the Spanish domain came from a French squadron led by Jean Ribaut who was searching for possible settlement sites for French Huguenots (Protestants) who wished to leave their Catholic dominated homeland. In May 1562, after exploring the coast northward from the St. John's River, Ribaut arrived at Santa Elena, which he named Port Royal. Impressed with the natural qualities of the harbor, Ribaut erected a stone column claiming the land for his king, Charles IX. He then constructed a small fortification known as Charlesfort on Parris Island. The fort was to serve as an outpost until Ribaut could return from France with more men and supplies. When Ribaut sailed away in June he left behind a garrison of 26 men. Though he promised to return within six months, political unrest in France delayed Ribaut, and the men at Charlesfort, suffering under the control of a harsh captain, mutinied, killed their commander, constructed a vessel and sailed to France.<><br>\n<b>The Battle for Florida<\/b><> When Spanish authorities in Cuba learned of Ribaut's fort, a warship was sent to search for the French. By the time the vessel reached Santa Elena the French garrison had already evacuated. The Spanish located and destroyed the abandoned Charlesfort and returned to Cuba.<br><br>In 1564, the French Huguenots returned to Spanish Florida and constructed Fort Caroline on the St. John's River. To end the French presence in Florida the Spanish King, Phillip II, hired Pedro Menendez to drive the French from Florida and to establish a series of colonies along the southeastern coast. During the fall of 1565 Menendez established a base at St. Augustine and then in a whirlwind campaign he captured Fort Caroline and eliminated the French presence in Spanish Florida.<\/div>"},{"latlng":[34.14231111,-81.40638889],"options":{"title":"St. Peter Church"},"popup":"<h1>St. Peter Church<\/h1><strong>On Dreher Road, Chapin, (On the right when traveling south)<\/strong><div><br>SC Gen.

Starting in 1941, as part of the World War II effort,The U.S. Government acquired the site of the strip and assembled a total of 3,815 acres for the Walterboro Army Airfield. Construction began in April 1942, and just four months later, on August 4, 1942, the base was activated. The completed installation consisted of a large airfield with extensive support facilities. Army Air Forces Fourth Service Command conducted combat air crew training. The Tuskegee Airmen were part of this effort. They were located near Tuskegee Circle, which is now the site of Walterboro High School. Many notable objectives were completed here. Trained pilots and crews went directly to combat in many parts of the world. There was a compound for German prisoners of war. The largest camouflage school in the country was located here. Approximately 600 acres were used for bomb storage. Air combat support was provided from Walterboro for many important defense facilities and cities, such as Santee Cooper Dams, the Parris Island Marine Base, the Navy Yard, and Charleston. This was a very desirable airfield location because it had good flying weather and was beyond the range of hostile navy guns.

Olive Baptist Church on Savage Street here in Walterboro, decided to go out to the then Colleton County Airport to witness an air show. We heard that the Valient Air Command of Titusville, Fla. was sponsoring this air show with old World War II vintage aircraft. We also heard some of the members were original Tuskegee Airmen who took their combat training here in Walterboro. We were very excited to meet them. Upon our arrival, we discovered that even though they did have members of the Tuskegee Airmen in the Valiant Air Command none came along for the air show. However, the gentleman who was running the Walterboro\/Colleton County Airport, Mr. Lloyd Vickery, also known as Airport Daddy, produced a letter he had recieved from an original Tuskegee Airman by the name of Col. Hiram E. Mann. He allowed us to make a copy of the letter. I could hardly wait until the next day, Monday, to call Col. Mann. He agreed to come to Walterboro and meet with us. We hastily put together a dinner meeting. I took him on a tour of Walterboro and the only thing he remembered was the water tower. Any way he agreed to come back the next year, 1994, and be our Parade Marshal for the Martin Luther King Parade. We put on one of the biggest parades we ever had that included the Marine Corp Band, a marching platoon from the National Guard, and a Bradley Tank. We put Col. Mann in a Humvee. We had the State Lt. Governor Nick Theodore and many other high ranking dignitaries. The word got out that we brought the Tuskegee Airmen back to Walterboro; thus the vision for the monument and the rest is history.<br> \nWe unveiled the Monument in 1997, we estimated 3,000 in attendance; we had about 19 original airmen and each recieved The Order Of The Palmetto from Gov.

With the assistance of the Design Arts Partnership at Clemson University and the SC National Heritage Corridor, the local chapter, with the City of Walterboro and Colleton County Council, raised funds to add a landscape plan and provide for interpretation (to be added a a later date). Once in place, the interpretation will tell the story of the Tuskegee Airmen, the history of Anderson Field, the German POW's who were there during World War II, and the Camouflage School used for training during the war. The goals are to make this a beautiful site that welcomes visitors flying into our airport, attracts families who visit their loved ones at the VA Nursing Home, and adds to tourism and our economic base.

Following the revolutionary War, increased numbers of settlers entered the parish's backcountry where it bordered on Four Holes Swamp System. Many of these pioneers indentured themselves to Charleston merchants who \nheld state land grants. Agreements were made to clear and plant the land, erect log cabins, or \"harvest\" pine sap for turpentine.<br><br> The sturdy, who preserved and survived malaria and yellow fever, amassed extensive land acquisitions. \n\nBunch Ford Road (SC 314) [Marker picture included] provided passage across Four Holes to St. George Parish, Dorchester. \n\nThe Old State Road (US 176) was an old Indian Trail that transversed the length of the settlement. It fell into the Old Gaillard \n\nRoad (SC 27) that connected Charleston to Vance's Ferry on the Santee River. In 1800, Francis Asbury, a Methodist circuit \n\nrider and preacher, founded the area's first church around a stump pulpit. The church was located at the head of gate where \n\ntar and other naval products were processed. Through the years tar-gate became Target. Target Church was the  of \n\nthe religious and social life and the Target Community grew and prospered. In 1855, the first school attracted many students. \n\nAfter the Civil War, a Reconstruction School reopened in the Target Community.<br><br>\nIn 1823, increased stagecoach travel between Columbia and Charleston resulted in improved routing of the Old State Road. \n\nA more direct leg of road by-passed the Target Community. Also, in 1825, the Camden Road (SC 310) was constructed to fall \n\ninto the new leg of the Old Stone Road. By 1827, Camden Fort Plantation was erected at this junction site, serving some 80 \n\nwagons around harvest time. Farmers quickly settled along these two new routes, Four ridges (\"hills\") crossed this section \n\nof the Old Stone Road. Holly trees were abundant. Mail arrived by horseback, twice weekly and the mail was addressed as \n\nHolly Hills - later Holly Hill. Visionary leaders saw the necessity for the settlement to have contact with more markets. In 1894, \n\nthe state chartered the Eutawville Railroad to cross Four Holes Swamp. This 34-mile spur line connected Holly Hill, \n\nEutawville, Vance, and Elloree to Charleston's then SC Railroad. In 1886, where the railroad crossed the Old Stone Road, the \n\nsite for the rural hamlet of Holly Hill was defined. On December 1887, the village was chartered as the \"Town of Holly \n\nHill\".<br><br> In 1868 the districts in South Carolina became counties.

It continues to serve today as an important reminder of the historic significance of our community.\n<br><br>\nWhen Spartanburg, founded in 1831 received its revised charter as a \"city\" in late 1880 with 3,253 inhabitants, the town council on December 2 purchased this Seth Thomas clock to install in the new opera house completed that year at a cost of $8,900 during the administration of intendent (mayor) L.P. Walker.\n<br>Standing on West Main Street at the site of the present masonic temple, the opera house was basically a town hall, on the ground floor were the town offices, the guardhouse and post office; on the second floor was an opera house with 700 seats for public gatherings and entertainment. The clock was at the very peak of the tower and was mounted above the bell. In addition to striking the hours, the bell also served as an alarm signalling the location of all fires by means of a special code.\n<br><br>\nTo Spartans of the 1880's, this clock and its bell were special hallmarks of a town suddenly growing as it became an important railroad . The third railroad into Spartanburg was completed in 1886. As a result, in that decade, the population grew 70 percent to 5,554 in 1890. \n<br><br>\nThe clock was purchased in 1881 for $966.02 plus a $43.98 freight charge. Originally it was set to be \"regulated by Washington Time\" which provided an allowance of 19 minutes and 32 seconds for the difference from 75 degrees west longitude. When installed, the timepiece had a pendulum weighing 125 pounds, a smaller weight of 125 pounds and a \"strike weight\" of 800 pounds. The largest wheel in the mechanism had a diameter of sixteen inches. The bell weighed 1,200 pounds and was audible all over the town which extended out in a radius of one mile from the courthouse. The Seth Thomas Clock Company, which had been established in 1813, contracted with M.D. Bradley to install the clock in the steeple.\n<br><br>\nIn the same month (January 1881) that the clock and the bell were installed in the opera house, the merchant's hotel opened adjacent to it on the public square. Three months later the Morgan Monument was unveiled in the middle of what was to become known as Morgan Square. Next to the hotel was the third county courthouse, built at the corner of Main and Magnolia Streets in 1856. A fourth courthouse at approximately the site of the present one was occupied in 1892.\n<br><br>\nIn October, 1906, the town council sold the city hall and opera house for $12,123 and the building was demolished in 1907. Fortunately, the clock and bell were transferred to the imposing courthouse tower where this time the bell was located above the clock. There this \"Heartbeat of Spartanburg\" remained and continued its steady service amid a rapidly changing urban society until that courthouse was torn down in 1958.\n<br><br>\nStored away, the clock was stilled and the bell mute for twenty years. In the 1970's efforts were begun by the Spartanburg Bicenntennial Committee to restore this symbol of the city in an appropriate central location. In the spring of 1979, thanks to the support of many citizens and federal community development grant assistance, the old clock and bell resumed their special, useful, and melodious service to the people of Spartanburg. Today Spartans hear the same bell that Spartans heard nearly a century before, a bell that has endured as has the community in which it was first installed.\n<br><br>\nThe preservation and restoration of the clock-works were the public-spirited contributions of Mr.Joe Griffin and the Griffin Machine Works.\n<br><br>\nThis plaque was made possible by the donations of Spartanburg school children who undertook to \"buy a piece of the clock\" for their community. Such was peculiarly appropriate since the quality of life of the community remains as always an obligation of the citizens of the future.\n<br><br>\nHearing the bell and knowing the hour will remind citizens of all ages of their heritage as Spartans and of their responsibility for the future and for the character of citizens yet to come. \n<br><br>\nThe restoration and construction of the tower were undertaken by the city of Spartanburg: Franklin W.

At the first meeting of the new Downtown Greenville Association, Charles Daniel told the members that the city was \"unclean and neither attractive nor competitive with comparable progressive cities.\"\n<br><br>\nIn an effort to renew downtown, Charles Daniel broke ground for his new headquarters on North Main Street in 1964. When completed in 1967, it was the tallest building in South Carolina. At the same time the <i>Greenville News-Piedmont<\/i> announced plans to build its new headquarters on South Main Street.\n<br><br>\n<i>[Bottom Panel 1]<\/i>:<br>\nUnder Max Heller's leadership, the revitalization of downtown became a priority in the 1970s. With the help of leaders like Buck Mickel, C. Thomas Wyche, and Alester G. Furman, Jr., a Total Development Plan was initiated by the Chamber of Commerce in 1976. The site of the Woman's College was renamed Heritage Green and there a new county library, the Charles E. Daniel Theatre, and the Greenville County Museum of Art were built.\n<br><br>\n<i>[Bottom Panel 2]<\/i>:<br>\nMax Heller's vision of an attractive, inviting, prosperous downtown would eventually become a reality through continued efforts by Mayors William D.

He won the Democratic primary but was defeated in the general election.\n<br><br>\n<i>[Bottom Two Panels]<\/i>:<br>\nMax was asked by Governor Richard W. Riley to serve as chair of the South Carolina State Development Board and for the next five years he worked with state and local officials to improve the state's economic climate. Max was convinced that diversification was essential and during his term more than 65,000 jobs were created. He created the South Carolina Research Authority and working closely with Governor Riley a number of major industries were recruited to the state, including Michelin North America, Union Camp and Digital Computer. For the first time, annual industrial recruitment reached the $1 billion mark.\n<br><br>\nIn the spring of 1987, a blue ribbon task force was formed by the Greater Greenville Chamber of Commerce and led by Max Heller, to address the question, \"What do we want to be in the year 2005?\" The result of their deliberations was a document called \"Vision 2005: Greenville, the Journey Forward.\" This vision called for ambitious goals, including a new performing arts , a year-round governor's school for the arts, a research park, an Upstate coliseum, and a University for Greenville, among others.\n<br><br>\n<><b>Inspired Leadership<\/b><>\n<i>[Top Two Panels]<\/i>:<br>\nMax Heller has always been a man of the people.

In 1938 Joseph Daniel Smith built a new corn grist mill at the same site. He built a dam on the rock shoal about 75 feet upstream of the bridge, drilling into the rock to stabilize the dam structure. The dam created a mill pond and water was carried from the pond to the mill in a face fashioned from 30 gallon steel barrels that passed through the bridge abutment. Originally, the mill was powered by an overshot waterwheel and later by a side shot turbine wheel with a vertical shaft. The mill was closed in the 1950s.

According to a log cabin historian, the cabin initially started in the Cherokee Indian style of construction and was finished using the English method. In other words, the cabin was begun by an Indian and finished by a white man. Also, the cabin originally had a dirt floor that was later jacked up and a wooden floor added.\n<br><br>\nGresham Callahan first appeared in the record books on the 1810 census. This indicates that he was a resident of Greenville County after 1800, but before 1810. Apparently, Mr. Callahan had a number of different monikers, one of which was \"Old Indian.\"\n<br><br>\nThe cabin was originally located in northern Greenville County, within a short distance of historic Poinsett Bridge. Poinsett Bridge was completed in 1819, and the cabin was used as the construction headquarters while the bridge was under construction. Poinsett Bridge is the oldest bridge still standing in South Carolina.\n<br><br>\nAt some point the ownership of the cabin passed to John H. Goodwin. In 1875 John Goodwin sold the cabin and 300 acres to Rev. John Jack Gosnell for $351.00. Three generations of Gosnells lived in the cabin until 1941.\n<br><br>\nThe Boy Scouts bought the property for a camp in 1927. The last member of the Gosnell family to live in the cabin, Luther Gosnell, served as the caretaker of the property until his death in 1941. The name the Boy Scouts used for their new camp was derived from Gresham Callahan. The name chosen was \"Camp Old Indian.\"\n<br><br>\nThe dry accounting of dates and numbers do little to reflect the colorful history of the Gosnell log cabin. At a meeting on Aug. 10, 2008 with several granddaughters of Luther Gosnell (Carol Gosnell Long, Tammy Poore Mason and Kathy Gosnell Janson) the ancient walls of pine echoed again the joys and sadness of life as it will never be known again in Greenville County.\n<br><br>\nPerhaps as many as ten babies were born in the cabin. Luther's wife, Lizzie Dill Gosnell, died of measles in 1928 while sitting in a chair in front of the fire. An uncle had his leg amputated on the kitchen table (the table was carried out first).\n<br><br>\nIn 1941 Luther has an epileptic fit in front of the fireplace. The attacked prevented control of his body and his spasms drove his legs into the hot fire. It was three days before anyone found him and he died of gangrene in the old Greenville General Hospital.\n<br><br>\nLife was tough in the foothills of Greenville County. Bears in search of food frightened little girls who peeped out at them through the chinks in the logs while remaining deathly still. Panthers, rattlesnakes and copperheads added to the danger.\n<br><br>\nLuther made his living as a farmer and a rock mason. There are rumors that he was a moonshiner and a bootlegger. The main meal for his family was corn meal and water, which also happen to be the main ingredients for corn liquor.\n<br><br>\nAfter 1941 the cabin remained on the Camp Old Indian property. It fell into disrepair and the camp did not have the resources to keep it up. Sam Phillips, Dave Chesson and Tim Brett were instrumental to having the cabin removed and restored at the Mauldin Cultural Center grounds.

Charles Pinckney (1757-1824) was one of the members of the Articles of Confederation Congress who actively worked for the calling of a convention to draft a constitution for the new United States. He was one of South Carolina\u2019s four delegates to the 1787 Constitution in Philadelphia. Pinckney played an active role in the Constitutional Convention and in the ratification process that followed. For the remainder of his life he was involved in politics at the state and national level as an ally and supporter of Thomas Jefferson.<br><br>\n\nIn 1776, the signers of the Declaration of Independence had pledged &#8220;their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor&#8221; to the cause for American independence. Charles Pinckney followed their precepts. Because of his public service, Pinckney neglected his personal affairs and lost his fortune - including Snee Farm.<br><br>\n\nThe acquisition and preservation of Snee Farm is a remarkable story of cooperation between private citizens and the federal government. In 1987, a group of South Carolinians formed an organization called The Friends of Historic Snee Farm. The group\u2019s sole purpose was to raise the funds necessary to purchase this 28-acre site as a lasting tribute to Charles Pinckney. By July 1988 The Friends had raised more that two million dollars, bought the property, and turned it over to the National Park Service for preservation and interpretation.<br><br>\n\nAlthough this property belonged to the Pinckney family for more than a half-century (1754-1817), this house was not Charles Pinckney\u2019s home.

There are many theories. One plausible explanation is that English traders who passed through here in the 1700s estimated this location to be 96 miles from the Cherokee village of Keowee to the northwest, near present-day Clemson. The first known historical reference to Ninety Six is on a map of 1730, created by George Hunter, surveyor general of South Carolina.\n<br><br>\nLong before the Europeans arrived in the 1700s -- as early as 900 B.C. -- bands of hunter-gatherers roamed here. The heavily forested land changed with time, as did the native groups, who began to clear fields for farming, weave cloth from natural fibers, and fashion pottery from the area's red clay soil. Of the many Indian groups who inhabited the backcountry near Ninety Six, it was the Cherokee who predominated and used this area as their hunting grounds.\n<br><br>\nPositioned at the crossroads of several critical trade routes that linked Cherokee territory to the city of Charleston on the coast, Ninety Six became a seat of power in the British colony of South Carolina.

In fact, it took at least 200 million years for them to form! The mountains rose up as huge slowly \"drifting\" blocks of the earth's rocky crust -- called \"plates\" -- collided with each other over millions of years and folded and thrust the rocks to form ridges.\n<br><br>\nBased on evidence gathered from Upstate rocks, geologists believe that the mountain building occurred in three main events. The first is called the Taconic Orogeny (period of mountain-building), which occurred between 480 and 450 million years ago. During this period, a group of islands located off the ancient coast of North America slowly collided with the eastern shore. The group of islands, called the Piedmont Island Arc, was probably similar to the islands that make up Japan. When the Piedmont Island Arc collided with North America, the edge of the North American plate was forced under the Piedmont Island Arc deep into the earth through a process called subduction until it began to melt from the heat of the earth's core.\n<br><br>\nThe newly molten rock began to expand and rise upward back into the earth's crust as granite. The eat and pressure changed the granite unto Table Rock Gneiss and Henderson Augen Gneiss that you see in the wall. The Poor Mountain Amphibolite on the wall is believed to have begun its life as an ocean floor basalt that was pushed against North America by the collision on the Piedmont Island Arc. As with the genisses, the heat and pressure of the collision transformed the basalt into amphibolite. These rocks probably went through several cycles of heat and pressure to reach the form that you see today.\n<br><br>\nThe second mountain building event occurred during the Acadian Orogeny between 400 and 350 million years ago, when another group of islands collided with the North American continent. again, the plate boundary of North America was forced under the newly attached island through subduction. The collision caused more folding and thrusting, which contributed to the formation of the Piedmont and added to the Appalachian Mountains. It was this collision that formed the rocks east of Greenville and includes those of the Columbia area.\n<br><br>\nThe final mountain-building event -- called the Alleghenian Orogeny -- occurred between 320 and 270 million years ago. These repeated collisions turned the Appalachian Mountains into a very high mountain range -- as big as the Rockies out west! But millions and millions of years of weathering and erosion have reduced the heights of the mountains to what you see today.\n<br><br>\n<b>Rock Samples<\/b><br>\n<u>Table Rock Gneiss<\/u><br>\nThis rock is grayish in overall color. Notice how the thin black layers separate the thicker, lighter-colored layers. This is called <i>foliation<\/i>.\n<br><br>\nThe dark layers are bands of a mineral called biotite; a black, flaky mica. The lighter-colored layers contain clear, glassy quartz and a white mineral called <i>feldspar<\/i>.\n<br><br>\n<u>Henderson Augen Gneiss<\/u><br>\nCompare the spotted Henderson Augen Gneiss to the layers in the table Rock Gneiss. These two types of rock are made of the same minerals, but they look very different. The white and pink \"spots\" in the Henderson Gneiss are called <i>augen<\/i>, the German word for \"eyes,\" and are made of feldspar.\n<br><br>\nThe augen feldspar are separated by dark layers of biotite mica and lighter layers of quartz and feldspar (just like in the Table Rock Gneiss) which wrap and flow around the augen.\n<br><br>\n<u>Poor Mountain Amphibolite<\/u><br>\nThe black, thinly layered rock is Poor Mountain Amphibolite. Look closely at the black layers. You can see long, shiny, blade-shaped crystals all pointing in the same direction within each black layer. These crystals are a mineral called <i>hornblende<\/i>. Because all of the hornblende crystals in the dark layers point in the same direction, the rock flakes apart into thin layers. between the dark layers, gray quartz, white plagioclase feldspar, and a mineral called <i>epidote<\/i> form thin, light colored layers. This amphibolite also contains a great deal of iron. The rust colored stains on the wall are caused by iron weathering out of the amphibolite.\n<br><br>\n<u>Sillimanite-Muscovite Schist<\/u><br>\nThis rock is pink to tan in color. Notice how the thin, wavy layers have been wrinkled and bent by heat and pressure deep inside the earth's crust. Some spots in the schist are very silvery and shiny. This shiny mineral is <i>muscovite<\/i>, a type of silver or clear mica.\n<br><br>\nThere are also very tiny grains of quarts in the schist. The pink or tan color is caused by pink to white feldspars. Like the quarts grains, the feldspar grains are very tiny and difficult to see.\n<br><br>\nFinally, there is a white, fibrous mineral present in the rock. This is <i>sillimanite<\/i>. It forms thin, stringy fibers that look like white cotton candy twisted through the rock.\n<br><br>\n<u>Diabase<\/u><br>\nThe black rock that you see sticking up into the other layers from the bottom of the wall is called diabase. Diabase is an <i>igneous<\/i> rock, which means it formed when molten rock from deep in the earth squeezed into cracks in the earth's crust about 180 million years ago. It is made of tiny grains of dark gray yo black plagioclase feldspar and a black mineral called <i>pyrozene<\/i>. Diabase is very different from the other rocks in the wall. The gneisses, amphibolite, and schist are <i>metamorphic<\/i> rocks, which means they were formed under great heat and pressure that made the rocks as soft as Silly Putty. Diabase, a much younger rock, has never been subjected to this kind of heat and pressure, and therefore does not have layers of foliation like the other rocks.<\/div>"},{"latlng":[34.84916667,-82.40416667],"options":{"title":"Historic Plants Garden"},"popup":"<h1>Historic Plants Garden<\/h1><strong>Near Reedy View Drive, Greenville, <\/strong><div><br>\nAgricultural plants that were grown and sold by farmers are important to Greenville's history. For many years, most families in Greenville made their living by farming.\n<br><br>\n<><b>Corn, Wheat and Oats<\/b><>\nIn the early 1800s, corn, wheat, and oats were the most commonly grown crops in Greenville. These were turned into flour in a mill, then used to make foods and animal feed.\n<br><br>\nAfter the Civil War, soil was poor, many men were lost, and families had little money or livestock. The 1866 harvest was poor, so many planters lost all they owned and left Greenville during that time. The railroads had come to Greenville, providing faster transportation than animals, so there was less need to grow grains for feed. As Greenville grew and developed a textile industry, cotton became the most profitable crop to grow.\n<br><br>\n<><b>Cotton<\/b><>\nIn Greenville's early years, cotton, the major crop in other parts of South Carolina, was not of great importance in Greenville. But by the late 1800s, cotton production was on the rise. Greenville was the state's third largest cotton-producing country by 1915. Countrywide production peaked in 1920, when manufacturing and the railroad brought new growth to the region. As cloth-making became industrialized in Greenville, cotton's importance grew.\n<br><br>\nCotton's high price in 1915 encouraged more farmers to grow. It seemed a promising crop, but many problems lay ahead. It was difficult to grow and harvest. Whole families worked together to plant, tent, and pick up a crop. The school year was scheduled around cotton's growing season as kids could help their families harvest. Prices dropped as cotton production increased, so farmers lost money. Boll weevils arrived in 1917 and threatened cotton to extinction, ans still the price dropped. The return of European production after World War II decreased demand, and the Great Depression of 1929 added to the troubles of the cotton farmer. Their costs rose while their cotton was being sold for less money.\n<br><br>\nRelief was in sight, however. Through the Clemson Extension Service, Greenville County hired an agent who taught farmers modern farming techniques. Farmers learned new ways to grow corn and produce livestock, and a new peach industry flourished. Agriculture eventually declined in importance in Greenville as the modern city emerged.\n<br><br>\n<><b>Tea<\/b><>\nThe type of tea we most commonly drink in the South (iced tea) is made from the flavorful leaves of a variety of camellia (<i>Camellia sinensis<\/i>). Tea is the most consumed beverage in the world after water, and yet most of the tea we drink is not grown in the United States. The only tea farm in America is in South Carolina! On the island of Wadmalaw, 20 miles south of Charleston, tea has been grown since 1799, when a French botanist brought the first tea plants to America. You can find this \"American Classic Tea\" in grocery stores and try it for yourself! It is both the official White House tea and the Hospitality Beverage of South Carolina.\n<br><br>\nTea has a history even closer to home. Junius Smith moved to the Greenville District and decided to experiment with the growth of tea. He began to plant tea in 1848 on land about a mile from town owned by Dr. Charles B. Stone and then purchased 269 acres of his own on Golden Grove Creek and started his own tea farm.\n<br><br>\nAs you see here, teal still grows in Greenville.

A smaller subspecies called switch or mountain cane (<i>Arundinaria gigantea tecta<\/i> grows to about 4 feet high. Like all grasses, river cane blooms and produces seeds, but only does so infrequently (sometimes as long as 50 years between blooms). Cane reproduces by spreading underground with rhizomes and putting up new shoots every 12 to 18 inches.\n<br><br>\nArchaeological records indicate that Native American people began to use river cane nearly 9000 years ago. Because it is found in such a wide range of sizes and because it can be manipulated in a variety of ways, river cane was one of their most important plant species. It was used for arrows, spears, blowguns, baskets, sleeping and work mats, and even woven into the walls of lodges. Native Americans may have even planned the relocation of their villages around the abundance of river cane. When they began to deplete the canebrakes (thickets of river cane) near a particular village, they would begin nearly a year ahead to prepare for their new move to a lush and healthy canebreak. When they rebuilt their homes in the new location, they cut the black locust saplings in the canebreak for lodge poles and then cane to weave between the poles to pack with mud and form the walls.\n<br><br>\nEarly explorers of the southeast recounted seeing thick canebreaks many miles across. These canebreaks were likely maintained by fires set by the Indians who learned that fire killed off most competing plant species and made a healthier canebreak. Many species of animals thrived in the canebreak, such as bear and bison and even the Carolina Parakeet. Early white settlers grazes cattle and horses in canebreaks which was comparable to the finest pastures. While the great canebreaks are gone today, you can still find small canebreaks along rivers and streams throughout its range, and many people are again learning the value of river cane in preventing erosion of stream banks and providing wildlife habitat. Almost everywhere you see river cane today, there is evidence of Native American habitation nearby.\n<br><br>\nHere, we have replanted historic river cane so that it will stabilize the river banks, be a home for animals, and be discovered and studied by the children who visit the garden.<\/div>"},{"latlng":[34.84916667,-82.40416667],"options":{"title":"History of the Reedy River"},"popup":"<h1>History of the Reedy River<\/h1><strong>Near Reedy View Drive, Greenville, <\/strong><div><br>\nThe Reedy is Greenville's river.

Stands of wild canes appear along the river below the park.\n<br><br>\n<b>Shoals<\/b><br>\nThe river flows for several hundred yards over water-sculptured granite outcrops or shoals, which, coupled with the name of the family that owned the land in the area, gave rise to the name of the community. Perhaps a hundred yards wide at points, the river can be crossed at low water by walking and jumping from one sinuously carved rock to another. The river is a deep as 15 to 30 feet at some points.\n<br><br>\n<b>Lizards<\/b><br>\nLizards seen by the watchful observer are the five-lined skink or bluetail (from the royal blue tail sported by the males), the gray fence swift, and the Carolina green anole, which is sometimes miscalled the Carolina chameleon. While the anole usually appears in its lime green coloration and is capable of changing to shades of gray or brown, it is not a true chameleon.\n<br><br>\n<b>Fish<\/b><br>\nMany different types of fish have been caught in the river, which has been a popular fishing locale since residents traveled there in covered wagons 200 years ago. These include small-mouthed, large-mouthed, striped and white bass. There also are white perch, bream, blue gills, channel catfish and, rarely, pike. Since 1981, the town of Ware Shoals has held the Catfish Festival during the last weekend of May that draws thousands of visitors to its town square. There was one report of a 60-pound catfish being caught.\n<br><br>\n<b>Snakes<\/b><br>\nThere are several varieties of snakes, which inhabit the shoals' area\/ Various water snakes inhabit the river, but none are venomous. The copperhead and highland moccasin is the only poisonous snake in the area, but it tries to avoid human contact if possible. Black rat snakes, coach whips, green snakes, and garter snakes are infrequently sighted but can be found by someone seeking them out.\n<br><br>\n<b>Mammals<\/b><br>\nMammals living alongside the river include whitetail deer, raccoon, gray fox, opossum, gray squirrel and flying squirrel.\n<br><br>\n<b>Turtles<\/b><br>\nMany species of turtles such as the river cooters or soft shell are commonly seen sunning themselves stop the rocky shoals of the river. If you look closely you may also see snapping or monk \"Stink pot\" turtles in the water.\n<br><br>\n<b>Ware Shoals<\/b><br>\n<i>The Town and the River<\/i><br>\nA favorite spot for taking in the beauty of the area picnicking, wading and fishing, the banks of the Saluda River have drawn folks from the surrounding countryside for more than 200 years. The name of the owner of the nearby gristmill, Nicholas Ware, was combined with the river's shoals to create the name of Ware's Shoals, later shortened to Ware Shoals.\n<br><br>\nThe town sprang to life because of its proximity to the Saluda River where Abbeville, Laurens and Greenwood Counties meet along South Carolina's Heritage Corridor.\n<br><br>\n<b>The Town's Origins<\/b><br>\nThe town of Ware Shoals and Ware Shoals Manufacturing Company (later renamed Riegel Textile Corporation) were born in the same year - 1902. Nat Dial of Laurens county started the river dam construction at the turn of the 20th Century as a means of powering his cotton plant. When Dial ran out of money, he turned to New Jersey businessman, Benjamin Riegel who bought the mill and completed the dam. At the same time, Riegel fathered a town.\n<br><br>\n<b>The Mill's Role in the Town<\/b><br>\nThe economic and social life of ware Shoals revolved around the mill for more than 80 years. Generations of Ware Shoals' families worked in the textile mill, and for many of them, this was the only job and way of life they would ever know. Once one of the largest textile manufacturing s of the southeastern United States, Riegel Textile Corporation employed 5,000 people at its peak in 1960.\n<br><br>\nThe mill closing in 1985 had a major impact on the town's 2,000 citizens and its economy. But Ware Shoals fought back and continued to prosper. The mill site has been the beneficiary of a $2,700,000 investment in cleanup efforts and redevelopment through the Brownfields Project. Ware Shoals was presented with the 2001 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 4 Rising Star Award.\n<br><br>\n<b>Riegel Stadium<\/b><br>\nRiegel Stadium was built in 1931 utilizing laborers from President Roosevelt's nation-wide job program. The stadium is most renowned for baseball. Through the decades, Riegel Stadium has hosted high school teams, textile leagues, Negro leagues, American Legion ball and even the big leagues. A 1954 exhibition game here showcased the Cincinnati Red Legs and the Washington Senators.\n<br><br>\n<b>Memorial Fountain<\/b><br>\nThe Memorial Fountain in front of Katherine Hall was created in 1968 through the dedication of a number of local clubs to raise the needed funding and gifts donated as memorials to war veterans who worked at the mill.\n<br><br>\n<b>The \"Big Friendly\"<\/b><br>\nWare Shoals Town Hall is located in the former \"Big Friendly,\" as the Riegel Textile Corporation's company store was known. Started as a one-room shanty in 1906, the \"Big Friendly\" became one of the finest and most modern department stores in the state after its new location was completed in 1920. Its motto, \"You can buy in one store anything from a paper and pen to a Ford automobile, from a baby girl's rattle to her wedding dress\" reflected the extent of the store's role in the community. The store closed in 1963.\n<br><br>\n<b>Katherine Hall\/The YMCA<\/b><br>\nDedicated as the \"Peoples' Amusement Hall,\" Katherine Hall was named for the Riegel's only child when it was built in 1913. Katherine Hall, the  for the mill workers to relax, has housed a wide spectrum of community activities ranging from a movie theater to the Senior Citizens Center.<\/div>"},{"latlng":[33.491563,-81.972274],"options":{"title":"World War II Tribute"},"popup":"<h1>World War II Tribute<\/h1><strong>On Georgia Avenue (U.S. 25) , North Augusta, (On the right when traveling south)<\/strong><div><><b>World War II<\/b><br>\n1941 &#8212; 1945<br>\n Dedicated to the men and women<br>\nwho battled globally to<br>\nsecure a free world for<br>\nall mankind.

Much of the violence was generated by a larger conflict between France and England, known as the French and Indian War. In late 1759, Royal Governor William Henry Lyttelton arrived here with militia, occupied Gouedy's trading post, and converted it into a fort to protect local settlers. The fort was attacked twice by the Cherokee, on February 3 and March 3, 1760. In the March attack, 250 Cherokee warriors besieged the fort for 36 hours, but the garrison held strong.<\/div>"},{"latlng":[33.486516,-80.860437],"options":{"title":"Williams Chapel A.M.E.

He searched for \"a proper Place to build a Magazine and Stockade Fort.\" At the crossroads of Ninety Six, he found Gouedy's post.

An 1892 edition of the <i>Anderson Intelligencer<\/i> stated, \"The young men of Belton are happy. The stores close at 6:00 and the clerks have an opportunity to engage in lawn tennis.\"\n<br><br>\nBelton's first court was located in the triangle formed by the railroad tracks near the depot and later the famous Town Court stood where the Belton Tennis Center is located today. Tennis began to really catch on in Belton during the time between the two world wars. Belton's youth dominated play and produced many state high school champions. The high school girl's team did not lose a match for 14 straight years.\n<br><br>\nThe formation of the Belton Tennis Association combined with the number of public and private courts enabled the town to become the home of the Palmetto Tennis Championships in 1957. Belton girls sparkled in the early days of the Palmetto and won many titles in the 50s and 60s. The girl's high school team won 9 straight state championships between 1958 and 1967.\n<br><br>\nDuring the 1970s the Palmetto Championship became the state's national junior qualifying tournament. The 80s saw a major addition to the Belton tennis scene, the South Carolina Tennis Hall of Fame, located in the Belton Depot. The Hall of Fame showcases portraits and memorabilia of South Carolina's greatest tennis championships and volunteers.\n<br><br>\nBelton tennis continued to flourish over the years. The Hall of Fame Classic, the state's top high school girls tournament, was started in 1987. The Belton Tennis Center was expanded in the early 90s, the Palmetto Championships grew and prosperous, and local players and teams continued to win championships. Providing decades of the state's best junior tennis is a proud local tradition. Belton tennis provides a sense of place that may be best described by a tennis pro as he watched a young player compete in the Palmetto: \"The sweet smell and feeling of this match reminds me what is good about learning to enjoy tennis. What is good is that it happens to you. You become a player. You become someone with a chance of winning a match. You become someone with a history...you become someone who had played Belton!\"\n<br><br>\n<b>Historic Belton<\/b><br>\n<i>Child of the Railroad<\/i>\n<br><br>\n<b>Origins<\/b><br>\nThe town of Belton was chartered in 1855 as a \"child of the railroad.\" Judge John \"Belton\" O'Neal and a group of prominent leaders of South Carolina formed the Columbia and greenville Railroad Company to connect Charleston with Cincinnati by way of the Blue Ridge Railway. Work on this project began in 1847 and it soon became evident that the company could save $100,000 by following a path west of the Saluda River, crossing near Pelzer near Greenville. This met with extreme opposition from the Anderson stockholders. In order to retain their financial support, it was decided that a spur line be run from the courthouse at Anderson to connect with the regular line at Sugar Hill (now called Belton). This would take place on the property owned by Dr. George Brown who also donated land for the depot and town square. The decision to form this rail line sparked interest in many to locate to this junction and, thus, Belton was born.\n<br><br>\n<b>Belton Depot<\/b><br>\nBuilt in 1906, the depot once served two rail lines. The tracks for both lines are still intact. Although the Piedmont & Northern closed down, the Columbia and Greenville, now called the Pickens Railroad, is still in use. Visitors to Belton still near an occasional train's whistle. Today the renovated depot houses the South Carolina Tennis Hall of Fame and Belton's history museum, the Ruth Drake Museum.\n<br><br>\n<b>Growth and Prosperity<\/b><br>\nThe railroad brought phenomenal growth. Belton now only prospered economically, but also socially. People from miles around would gather to see the trains arrive and the local hotel on the town square served hot lunches. The inviting porch of the hotel soon became the social hub of the town where people would gather to discuss the issues of the day.\n<br><br>\n<b>Geer Hotel<\/b><br>\nA portion of the original hotel building still stands on Belton's historic square as Horton's Pharmacy. People from miles around would come to see the trains arrive and have lunch at the hotel. The inviting porch of the hotel soon became the social hub of the town.\n<br><br>\n<b>Tennis Courts<\/b><br>\nBack in 1892, the first tennis court was located in the triangle formed by the railroad tracks. At the time, tennis was a popular leisure activity, and hotel guests and others gravitated to Belton for tennis games. Tennis remains an important part of life in Belton which more than 50 tennis courts within the city today. The city is home to the South Carolina Tennis Hall of Fame and the annual Palmetto Tennis Championships.\n<br><br>\n<b>Belton's Living History<\/b><br>\nThe first brick building on the square was built in 1877 and the second and third floors of this building became the opera house known as Stringer's Hall. The introduction of the movies established the Pastime Theater which brought the best silent movies to town. The town square also boasted a skating rink and bowling alley.\n<br><br>\n<b>Local Landmarks<\/b><br>\nMany historic landmarks still stand today as reminders of Belton's rich past. One is the First Baptist Church. The first phase of the church was completed on October 11, 1861 and the beauty of its architecture can still be enjoyed today. rising above the city's skyline is the famous standpipe water tower, a landmark that can be seen for miles. The tower was built in 1908 and still stores part of the city's water supply.\n<br><br>\n<b>Living Traditions<\/b><br>\nBelton's cultural history comes to life through bluegrass concerts here at the depot on the second and fourth Saturdays of each month, and during the annual Standpipe Festival each fall.

Mr. James L. McGee was listed in the 1905 Anderson City Directory as a dealer in stock, buggies, wagons, and harnesses. By 1910, the small shop located at 131 West Benson Street was part of the Davis Brothers Livery and Boarding Stables which provided horses, mules, vehicles and harnesses, and was open 2 hours a day.\n<br><br>\nBy 1925, Elias and Willis McGee became owners of the Davis and McGee Mule Company, which ran a multi-purpose facility with a harness shop, stables, livestock sales and wagon dealership. Their address a 129-130 West Benson included he office of Dr. E.R. Vendergrift, a veterinarian surgeon.\n<br><br>\nIn early 1940's, the West Benson Street business was owned by the McGee Brothers (J. Willis, T. Elias, and Wayne L.). There was a harness shop, livestock sales and wagon sales. At the same address were the offices of Mr. Samuel Cathcart, an architect, and U.S. Selective Service System Board #5.\n<br><br>\nBy the early 1950's, the McGee Bros. had to remove the harness shop because of the widening of Murray Avenue and the tools were placed in what had been the empty living quarters of a blacksmith at the McGee Farm in Starr. At that time, the current harness shop structure was converted from living quarters to a working harness shop. The placement of the tools and the actual arrangement of the room are authentic to this period of time.\n<br><br>\nIn the fall of 2004, the harness shop was moved from the McGee Farm and reconstructed at the Anderson County Museum.\n<br><br>\nThe harness shop was a vital part of a community at the turn of the century. The harness shop and blacksmith shop were essential elements of a thriving town. Whenever someone rode a horse, drove a buggy or hitched a team to plow a flied, they were using leather straps to \"harness\" the muscle power of the animal so humans could control it and use it for productive work. In the age when animals still provided most of the power for farmers and transportation, the welfare of the community depended on the skill of the craftsmen who know now to work leather. The harness maker used specialized tools to repair broken harness or \"tack\" and manufactured new equipment when necessary.\n<br><br>\nThe harness has four basic functions:\n<ol>\n<li>It allows the horse to pull the carriage (collars and traces)\n<li>It provides a braking mechanism (saddle, tug loops, belly bands)\n<li>It provides a stabilizing mechanism (breeching and holdbacks)\n<li>It provides a steeling mechanism (bridle, bits and reins)\n<\/ol>\n<br>\nGiven in memory of T.

The \"Old Reformer\" is also one of the oldest artifacts in the Upstate, since it arrived here before the town of Anderson Court House or the County existed. The artillery arrived in the Upstate in 1814, when the cannon was transported from Charleston to the Upstate to protect the settlers during the War of 1812. The cannon was thought to have been brought to the Americas in 1764 by German emigrants settling in Charleston.\n<br><br>\nIn the years following the War of 1812, the cannon was forgotten until it was moved to Anderson in the late 1850s. One legend states that the name \"Old Reformer\" became its nickname at this time. The artillery piece was fired to announce the signing of the Ordinance of Secession in 1860 and possible on a few other wartime occasions. By this time, its original carriage was gone due to neglect and age.\n<br><br>\nIn 1876, the cannon made another appearance during the South Carolina gubernatorial campaign of Wade Hampton. His political movement, known as the \"Red Shirts,\" fired the cannon off during political speeches throughout the Upstate and announced his election win.\n<br><br>\nAbout this time the cannon, now just the barrel, disappeared from history until it was found buried in the ground near the Anderson freight depot on South Fant Street. It was placed in the garden of the Hubbard House on Calhoun Street for a few years until it was rescued by members of the Cateechee Chapter of the Daughters of American Revolution in 1905-06. The barrel was then placed on cement supports at the intersection of North Main and Orr Street across from Central Presbyterian Church.\n<br><br>\nWithin a few years it had become a traffic hazard. In 1920, Mayor Foster Fant had a make-shift carriage built for the \"Old Reformer\" and a plaque attached. The cannon was then placed on the Plaza near the Confederate Monument.

Within a mile of this spot are the sites of a colonial ironworks, a Revolutionary War skirmish, and one of the most historic textile mills in the South. Today, the village still remains, but the mill is gone, destroyed by a fire in 2004. Glendale lives on as a small community with a proud past, quickly changing present, and exciting future.\n<br><br>\nThe 30-acre Glendale Shoals Preserve is a partnership between the Spartanburg Area Conservancy (SPACE), Palmetto Conservation Foundation (PCF), and Wofford College.\n<br><br>\nIn 1993, the Spartanburg Area Conservancy received a gift of 13 acres from Billy Tobias and created the Glendale Shoals Preserve. Today this area, across the river, offers picnic tables, nature trails, and access to Lawson's Fork.\n<br><br>\nIn 2004, the Palmetto Conservation Foundation purchased the Glendale Methodist church and established the Glendale Outdoor Leadership School (GOLS). The original church building houses a rock climbing wall, offices, and meeting space. Just a short walk away is a nature trail for mountain biking or hiking with access to the 6-acre Glendale Greenway.\n<br><br>\nIn 2009, Wofford College opened the Goodall Environmental Studies Center as a 3-acre field station for its new environmental studies program. Wofford's Carolyn F. Converse Teaching Garden is open to the public daily and offers a bog, raised beds, a native grape vineyard, and pollinator garden.\n<br><br>\n<b>A Brief History of the Glendale Mill<\/b><br>\nWhen textile pioneer James Bivings moved to Glendale from Lincolnton, NC in 1834 he purchased 750 acres along Lawson's Fork to develop a textile mill that would be in continuous operation for almost 150 years.\n<br><br>\nBack then this area was known as Bivingsville, and for the first few decades the Bivingsville Cotton Manufacturing Company was the largest cotton mill in Spartanburg County.\n<br><br>\nOver the years, the mill changed hands several times. Dexter Edgar Converse put his life savings into purchasing the mill with Bomar and Company in 1855, and expanded it to 1,435 spindles, 26 looms, and 58 workers. After the Civil War broke out, the Bivingsville Cotton Manufacturing Company began weaving cloth. Many mills in the area at this time were facing bankruptcy, but Dexter E. Converse keep the Bivingsville Cotton Manufacturing Company afloat by bartering cloth during these tough times.\n<br><br>\nIn 1870, the Bivingsville Cotton factory was sold to Converse and his cousin, Albert Twichell, and the mill's name changed to D.E. Converse & Company. The mill not only survived the Panic of 1873 and Reconstruction, but expanded to 5,000 spindles, 120 looms, and 175 workers. The mill village had grown to 60 homes. In 1878, Bivingsville's name changed to Glendale, on the suggestion of Converse's wife after she made a trip to Glendale, California. In 1899, Dexter E. Converse died and his brother-in-law, Albert Twichell, became the next president.\n<br><br>\nGlendale prospered as the century turned. By 1900, the town had a school with 125 students and one teacher. However, finding workers for the mill became an increasing problem and workers were recruited from as far away as the mountains of North Carolina. World War I brought increased work for Glendale and the other textile mills of the Piedmont. In the 1930s the Great Depression hit the mills hard, but with World War II the textile community boomed once again. The mill ran three shifts to meet the demand.\n<br><br>\nFrom 1946 until 1957 the mill was owned and operated by J.L. Stifel and Sons of Wheeling, West Virginia. They made major renovations, concerting the mill from steam power to electricity and remodeling many of the company houses. The new owners town down about 35 houses they were in bad condition, leaving about 120 houses in the village.\n<br><br>\nIn the 1950s, the company began to sell the houses to the workers. In 1957 Stifel and Sons sold the mill (employing 600) to Indian Head Mills. The sale proved to be the beginning of the end for textile manufacturing in Glendale. Indian Head Mills stopped manufacturing in the mill in November 1961.\n<br><br>\nThe village of Glendale once had a small but thriving business district. During the period the mill was in operation, Glendale had a machine shop, carpenter shop, circular sawmill, wool-carding mill, and a general store. There was also a butcher shop, radio repair shop, show shop, and a hot dog shop called Reeves.\n<br><br>\nAfter the mill ceased operations these businesses eventually closed down or left the area. from 1961 until 2004 the vacant mill was used by several owners for warehouse space including the storage of Rolls Royce parts. After the factory burned in 2004, present-day owner Glyn Morris and his partners donated the remaining mill office building to Wofford College. He also donated six acres along the river to the Palmetto Conservation Foundation to build this trail.\n<br><br>\nToday Glendale has finally left the industrial revolution behind and it's posed to become a hub of tourism, recreation, education, and service in this century.\n<br><br>\n<b>Explore the Shoals<\/b><br>\nFollow the trail to learn more about the human and natural history of Glendale.

He \n\ndevised the strategy of marching on the British in Virginia while the French fleet prevented an escape by sea. \n\nWashington trapped General Cornwallis at Yorktown in 1781, capturing 7,000 troops and winning American \n\nindependence.<br><br>\nAs a Virginia delegate to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, Washington, serving as the \n\nassembly's president, provided the moral authority and quiet leadership needed to facilitate compromises. Even \n\nat this time, he was known as a \"Founding Father.\" Following ratification of the Constitution, he was unanimously \n\nelected the first president and inaugurated in New York on April 30, 1789.<br><br>\nPresident Washington toured the southern states in 1791. His enormous personal popularity served as a \n\nsignificant force in binding the former thirteen colonies into a single nation. On May 2, he landed at Prioleau's \n\nWharf, one block south of the Exchange and Customs House. While in Charleston, President Washington met \n\nwith numerous officials, planners and merchants, worshipped at St. Michael's and St. Philips's churches, spoke \n\nto various gatherings of citizens and attended several balls held in his honor.<br><br>\nHe also enjoyed the hospitality of two fraternal groups of which he was a member - the Masons and the Society of \n\nthe Cincinnati. In his diary, he made several complimentary notes about Charlestonians. Referring to a concert \n\nheld at the Exchange, Washington remarked that \"there were at least 400 ladies - the Number and appearance of \n\nwhich exceeded anything of the kind I had ever seen.\"<br><br>\nWashington was unanimously reelected in 1792. Confronted with the competing philosophies of northern \n\nbusinessmen and southern planters, President Washington had a unique ability to recognize and promote the \n\nbest of each. Leaving office after two terms, he established the tradition of peaceful transition of power. Retiring to \n\nMount Vernon, he managed his plantation, entertained many visitors and remained a valued political and military \n\nadvisor until his death on December 14, 1799. <br><br>\nOf his many achievements, he is most loved for his honesty.

His duty assignments included Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point, \n\nCommander of United States ground forces in the Republic of South Vietnam and Chief of Staff of the United \n\nStates Army. General Westmoreland led troops in 17 battle campaigns in three wars.

With its court house, stores, artisans, and grist mills to grind the wheat produced by local farmers, Camden was the political and economic  of the surrounding region. Joseph Kershaw and others made their fortunes doing business in the town. \n<br><br>\nCamden\u2019s importance increased during the Revolution because of its location along the Great Wagon Road. Troops and supplies moving overland had to travel through Camden or take a longer route west of the town. Roads to Cheraw, Augusta, Georgia, and Cross Creek, North Carolina, also passed through Camden. \n<br><br>\nAfter the British occupied South Carolina, Camden became their main supply base in the southern backcountry, as well as the starting point for their intended invasion of North Carolina. The farms in and around Camden fed the British garrison. Camden was also a vital link through which supplies and reinforcements from Charleston were shipped to the Loyalists who lived farther west along the Broad and Saluda rivers and around Ninety Six and to the British units supporting them. \n<br><br>\nCamden was equally important to the Americans. If they could retake the town, North Carolina would be secure from invasion and the Loyalists in western South Carolina would be cut off from British support. The British would no longer have the chance to subjugate the other southern states and would be forced to withdraw to the coast. These factors made Camden the strategic key for both sides in the Southern Campaign. \n<br><br>\nIn addition to being the scene of two major Revolutionary War battles, Camden was at the  of the bloody fighting that raged through the South from 1778 to 1781.

Their eldest child Francis Richard Lubbock served as Governor of Texas (1861-1865) and the town of Lubbock, Texas was named for him.\n \nThe property was sold in 1832 to Otis Mills, a wealthy entrepreneur and financier who developed the original Mills House, one of Charleston's premier antebellum hotels. In the early twentieth century 6 Water Street was converted into 10 apartments. It was rehabilitated back to use as a single family residence in the 1960s.\n \nWater Street follows the course of Vanderhorst Creek, which was filled in during the first decade of the 19th century.

The original church was a brick structure covered with stucco and painted white with a combination of straight and curved lines. The building was completed and consecrated on December 23, 1849 by the Right Reverend Christopher E. Gadsden. A two- story annex was built at the south of the church in 1924 and housed the kindergarten. Services ended at the old building on November 25, 1940, and the church was deconsecrated. The property was sold and monies from the sale were used to build the present building at Line and Percy Streets.

Soldiers from the second battalion arrived in early July, camping, even closer to the river bank; with the officers tents nearest of all.\n<br><br>\nDuring their time in Cheraw, the prime role was to maintain law and order and to encourage loyalty to the King; to gain intelligence on the activity of rebel troops from Loyalists, passing this on to Commanders in Camden and other British detachments at Hanging Rock, Rocky Mount and Waxhaw. Major McArthur was only too aware of the need to hold the northern line; and to defend his soldiers against any approaching Patriot troops in the vicinity, who were pushing south and westwards. \n<br><br>\nSmall units accompanied Major McArthur to the Court Houses at Long Bluff (Society Hill) and Anson County (Wadesboro), where he administered the Oath of Allegiance, to any citizens who continued to swear loyalty to the King. As food supplies began to dwindle severely and in need of horses for their few accompanying dragoons, there was an increasing need to live off the land, even commandeering supplies from local people.\n<br><br>\nAt best estimate, some 300 men from the Regiment were camped here, with Surgeon Jackson reporting that two hundred men suffered from a malignant fever, brought on, he believed, by the noxious vapors off the river. It spread so rapidly, particularly amongst those camping closest to the river, that before late July, when the post was abandoned, &#8220;few were left who had not felt its influence&#8221;. Major McArthur wrote of suffering from the fever himself, for most of their six weeks spent in Cheraw. \n <br><br>\nSome of the men worst affected by the fever were taken into St David\u2019s Church nearby, it is said, to gain shelter from the reported excessive heat and heavy rain of that summer. Local diarists and other historians record that several men of the Highlanders died in Cheraw and are buried in this cemetery. Neither their Commanding Officer McArthur, nor the Surgeon who treated the men, made reference to this in their records, probably due, however, to the severe demands on them at the time. \n<br><br>\nAt burials in the field, it was customary for an Officer to say a short prayer, with Officers mostly being buried separately and Other Ranks being buried together. They were usually wrapped in simple shrouds, sometimes with a keepsake from home, perhaps a favorite pipe, having been stripped of their clothing and shoes, by their surviving comrades who had a greater need of them. Major McArthur\u2019s letter written on the 29th July 1780 confirms that all his men had been in want of such essential &#8220;necessaries&#8221; since October 1778.\n<br><br>\nThe official Muster Rolls for this Regiment are some of the most incomplete of the British Military in the 18th Century. There are no Rolls in existence for the soldiers of the 71st Frasers which specifically record the place and date of death, during the summer of 1780. Some records for 1780 were only completed from distant memories, after the British surrendered at Yorktown.\n<br><br>\nWhen the two detachments were ordered back to Camden, Surgeon Jackson wrote that &#8220;about forty&#8221; of the men were still too weak to march. Major McArthur committed these to the command of their Liuetenant John Nairne, to be escorted under the protection of Lt. Colonel William Mills and his local Loyalist Militia. On 24th July 1780, they embarked on flatboats at Kershaw\u2019s Landing, to be taken to Georgetown. The boats were ambushed at Hunts Bluff down river from Cheraw on 25th July by Patriot forces led by Captain Tristram Thomas. These sick soldiers of the 71st Fraser Highlanders were taken as captives into North Carolina and exchanged later for local Patriots being held as prisoners by British forces.\n<br><br>\nThe other soldiers, meanwhile, had marched back to Camden, with Surgeon Jackson recording that many of the men recovered through the exercise and fresh air on the march. Though some still too sick were held in reserve, the remainder of the 71st Fraser Highlanders fought in the Battle of Camden on 16th August 1780.\n<br><br>\nIn memory of those unnamed soldiers of the 71st Fraser Highlanders who died here in Cheraw, a Memorial Headstone, has been dedicated this day, Sunday 13th November 2011, to honor them all and is placed at the grave of one Officer buried on the north side of the church.\n<br><br>\nAnother Officer is believed to be buried near the eastern Vestry door, with several Other Ranks being buried together, in a &#8220;sink or depression &#8220;close to the door on the south side of the church. These two grave sites are each identified by a small Marker. \n<br><br>\n       \n&#8220;When duty calls me, I must go, to stand and face another foe,<br>\nBut part of me will always stay, o\u2019er the hills and far away\u2026\u2026<br>\nIf I should fall to rise no more, as many comrades did before,<br>\nAsk the pipes and drums to play, o\u2019er the hills and far away.&#8221; <br>\n  (From a Traditional Melody.)\tSJB 2011<\/div>"},{"latlng":[34.30583333,-82.66333333],"options":{"title":"1965"},"popup":"<h1>1965<\/h1><strong>On East Front Street, Iva, (On the left when traveling south)<\/strong><div><br>\nThis building and lot donated to the Town of Iva and the Iva District 10 Fire Department by W.

William Lucas, the son of the mills builder, was born at the windmill site in 1789. The project was completed in 1792. Trees from the plantations of the Santee region were rafted together and floated downstream to Mill Island where they were cut into boards that were used in construction projects.<br><br>The mill might have resembled a Dutch ~ style windmill with a small wooden superstructure sitting on top of a tower made of brick. The blades or sails were once attached to this sixteen - foot iron shaft and were driven by the strong winds coming off the ocean. The shaft was in a horizontal position (at a slight angle) at the top of the tower. A large wooden gear located at the  transferred the power to another gear and vertical shaft that carried the power to a second horizontal shaft that operated several reciprocating saw blades.<br><br>In the late 1820\u2019s the abandoned mill, now without blades, was being mistaken for the nearby lighthouse and was considered a threat to navigation. A wooden cross was placed on it\u2019s top so that it would not be confused with the light tower.

He settled there soon after in 1783. His talents as a millwright were discovered in a most curious way. While walking on King Street, John Bowman of Peachtree Plantation on the Santee River, noticed a small wind mill perched on the gable end of a store. Bowman, who was interested in wind power, entered the store and inquired as to hwo was the maker. He was told that he was Lucas, then a resident in the house, a man in need of work. A meeting was held and the machinist returned to the Santee with Bowman who quietly pointed out the difficulties under which the rice planter labored. The result was the first successful water powered Rice Pounding Mill. This mill and the ones Jonathan Lucas developed in later years would change the entire economy of South Carolina and make wealthy men of the Carolina Rice Planter.<br><br>\n\n<b>The Rice Pounding Mill at Wambaw Plantation<\/b>\n<br><br>\nThe property on which the mill was built was one of four plantations once owned by Daniel Horry II including adjoining Hampton Plantation.

Leave with a sense of awe sparked by visiting a site important to people thousands of years ago. As you sit watching the river, imagine the lives of the Native Americans who stopped here on their seasonal migrations between the coast and the uplands of the state.\n<br><br>\n<b>What to look for...<\/b><br>\nThe preserve protects two Native American soapstone quarries. Early residents of the state came here between 3000 and 1100 B.C. to obtain material to make bowls, pipes, and other necessities. The soapstone outcrops are fragile and should not be touched.\n<br><br>\nTwo uncommon plant species, a moss and a leafy liver wort are also protected within the preserve. Less rare, but no less interesting, are the summer pine\/hardwoods along the Pacolet River. In summertime, the forest shelters wood thrushes, red-eyed vireos, Eastern wood pewees and yellow-billed cuckoos, along with more commonly-seen songbirds. Reptiles and amphibians love the woods, too. Look for harmless, black rat snakes and Eastern kingsnakes, as well as gray treefrogs, toads and other amphibians. Allow about 30 minutes to walk the short trail from the parking area to the river.\n<br><br>\n<b>When to go...<\/b><br>\nThe preserve is open from daylight to dark. Spring and fall are the best times to see migrating songbirds, and the hardwoods should produce good fall color.\n<br><br>\n<b>What is Soapstone?<\/b><br>\nSoapstone is a metamorphic rock found along the collision zones of tectonic plates. To the touch this sock has a soapy or oily feel because its major component is the soft mineral talc. Outcrops of soapstone occur along northwestern margins of the King's Mountain Shear Zone. This geological one marks the boundary between the Inner Piedmont Belt and the Carolina Slate Belt and the meeting place of two ancient continents. Created during the Ordovician period (490 to 443 million years ago) these soapstone outcrops are reminders of powerful geologic processes that produced the South Carolina that we know today. Sometime during the Archaic Period (8,000 - 3,000 BC) Native American people started quarrying this material for use as hunting tools, jewelry and because of its superior ability to with stand thermal shock it was turned into cooking slabs and bowls.\n<br><br>\nPrior to the development of pottery in the Late Archaic Period, 4,000 - 3,000 BC, soapstone was an important raw material for Southeastern Indians. Raw nuts and tubers, a large component of the prehistoric forager's diet, required cooking before they were edible. Archaic peoples, prior to the invention of pottery, devised an indirect method of cooking. Indirect cooking is accomplished by placing heated stones directly into containers holding water and other foods. The hot stones transfer heat to the food while inside the container. Earth ovens were another method of cooking, very similar to dutch over cooking, involving heating stones and dampened vegetable matter. Large pieces of meat or quantities of tubers could be wrapped up in bundles of large leaves then laid over heated stones in a pit, and covered over with soil to cook.\n<br><br>\nThe use of heated rocks to cook food has been documented in archaeological sites across the Southeast. After a few uses most rocks disintegrate due to rapid heating and cooling, known as thermal shock, leaving behind fire cracked rock. Soapstone has a superior resistance to thermal shock, and because it is a soft stone it can be carved into easily transportable objects. Perforated soapstone discs have been found throughout the coastal plain and in other parts of South Carolina well away from the material's geologic occurrence. Mobility was important to the people of the Southeast during the Paleoindian and Archaic periods. These people were dependent upon their ability to relocate to areas where they could take advantage of seasonally available foods, soapstone slabs made cooking unpalatable foods in areas of that state that are stone poor a possibility.\n<br><br>\nDuring the Late Archaic Period, soapstone technology might have assumed a position of greater value to the cultures of the Southeast. Worked soapstone discs and bowls from the Late Archaic Period have been found as far afield as the panhandle of Florida and the coastal plain of Louisiana. These locations are hundreds of miles from natural deposits of soapstone and their presence has been attributed to trade or migration of groups between these areas and upland regions. Also during this period, pottery took over as the predominant cooking technology and potsherds have been found to co-occur with soapstone bowls and discs. While pottery was used for the production of everyday food, feasts might have had communal importance that required the use of soapstone, because with it, large amounts of food could be cooked quickly, and because of its importance as an ancestral tool.\n<br><br>\nIn 1969, Terry Ferguson and students from Spartanburg's own Wofford College documented the soapstone outcroppings present within the boundaries of the Pacolet River Heritage Preserve. They are part of a chain of outcroppings that extend from Croft State Park into Cherokee County. Most outcrops exhibit evidence for their use by prehistoric Native Americans. The people who utilized it as a resource likely considered this area very special. We know from ethnographic evidence that prehistoric Native Americans. The people who utilized it as a resource likely considered this area very special. We know from ethnographic evidence that prehistoric people have special connections with areas of unique resources. And now, the Pacolet River Heritage Preserve protects these outcropings. They are as unique and important now as they were them.\n<br><br>\nToday, artifacts from this area help fill in out interpretations of prehistoric times. Disturbing the artifacts, and the soapstone outcrops, harms our ability to learn bout the past from material remains and prevents future research from gaining an accurate picture. Collecting artifacts on the preserve site is strictly prohibited by State Law.\n<br><br>\n<b>The Great Flood of 1903<\/b><br>\nDuring the 19th Century, early settlers of Spartanburg County concentrated on developing farms and industries along the floodplains of rivers and creeks. These areas provided good soil for farming and waterpower for mills. When major textile manufacturing decided to take advantage of the Pacolet River. Water provided the power for the large thread spinners and weaving looms at the Pacolet and Clifton Mills. With the opening of these mills, communities developed. Textile mill owners provided lodging for their \"mill operators\" in the immediate vicinity of the mill, because their industrial work schedule demanded they be close to work around the clock. Wages were often paid in store credit, only redeemable at the mill village's company store. The mills generated more than textiles in Spartanburg County, they provided jobs, economic stability and created new communities.\n<br><br>\n<b>Accounts of the Great Flood of 1903...<\/b><br>\nBy the sixth of June, 5 inches of rain fell across Upstate South Carolina and western North Carolina. Between 5:30 am and 6:30 am, the waters of the Pacolet River rose 40 feet. The force of this flood battered everything in its path. A dam at Pacolet Mills resisted the flood for a while, diverting the floodwaters into the mills on the west bank of the river. Pacolet Mills No. 1 and No. 2 were devastated by the impact of rushing water and debris. Pacolet Mill No. 3, though severely.\n<br><br>The effects of the flood were felt throughout the county. When the waters began receding, 3,500 bales of cotton and 4,500 bales of cloth dotted the banks of the river along with broken machinery and debris that formed constituted businesses, mills and homes. The flood isolated the county from relief. Every bridge across the river, save one wagon bridge washed away, including the Southern Railway trestles crossing the Pacolet and Lawson's Fork. The trestle over Lawson's Fork weighed in excess of 2,500,000 lbs and the flood waters carried it 150 yards downstream.\n<br><br>\nTheir jobs, and homes, swept down the river, 3,500 people were temporarily unemployed. \"Mill operators\" were in high demand so companies across the region absorbed the people into their work force. 15,000 people were temporarily homeless after the flood receded.\n<br><br>\nThe bridge abutments down this trail are all that remain of a rock and concrete bridge washed out during the Great Flood of 1903.

As the high water thundered downstream from mill village to mill village, people in the path of the flash flood had no warning it was coming. Before the morning was over, the day would become the deadliest flood event in state history.<br><br>\n\nHistorical accounts claim 70 deaths from the flood, but the toll was likely many more. The flood's fury destroyed four textile mills and inflicted heavy damage to two others, laid waste to at least 75 homes and wiped out warehouses filled with cotton bales. Many of the victims were never found; others were buried where their bodies were discovered, some as far away as Union County. The flood left a 12-mile-long path of devastation strewn with textile machinery, downed trees, flattened houses, washed-out bridges, and the bodies of its victims. More than 4,000 cotton mill employees from Converse to Pacolet were without paychecks for many months.<br><br>\n\nThe loss of life began here in Converse, where the Clifton No. 3 mill was hit with a wall of water 20-25 feet high and moving at 40 mph. The power plant gave way first, followed by the smokestack, the entire mill, and then the dam. Only three of the mill's 198 7,000 pound looms were ever found, discovered several miles downstream. Sixteen mill houses washed off their foundations on this side of the river, taking the lives of at least a dozen people. A highway bridge over the Pacolet just down river from Clifton No. 3 was destroyed, and the electric trolley rails were ripped up, never to return to Converse.<br><br>\n\nTwo miles farther downstream, at Clifton No. 1 mill, a foot bridge used by workers to reach the factory washed out in the first wave of floodwater. Sections of the mill began to fall soon after, until one-third of the structure was gone. Muddy water, slimy silt, and tons of detritus poured through the openings and filled the mill to the ceilings. Riverside homes washed into the torrent, and people on the shoreline reported seeing flood victims clinging to the rooftops that had become unlikely rafts in the deadly river. Onlookers were able to do little as the horrible scene unfolded in front of them.<br><br>\n\nThe floodwaters moved downstream and continued its attack. At Clifton No. 2 mill and the nearby Santuck community, families scrambled to the tops of trees, but the flood still exacted its greatest human toll. No one knows for sure how many people were in the dozens of mill houses there that washed away, but at least 60 people in the area - including 11 in one family - were reported killed in just a few hours.\n<br><br>\nThe flooding on the river's tributaries only added to the debris that roared down the Pacolet. Below Clifton mills, Lawson's Fork Creek - swollen with floodwater from heavy rains in northern Spartanburg County - carried four collapsed cotton warehouses, hundreds of bales of cotton, and a Southern Railway trestle three miles from Glendale Mill and dumped them in the Pacolet to batter the communities downstream.\n<br><br>\nAs waters in Converse were beginning to recede, 12 miles downstream in Pacolet the destruction was just beginning. Residents were evacuated to higher ground and watched in horror as Pacolet Mill No. 1 fell first, followed by mill No. 2, where floodwater poured from the second floor windows as it collapsed. Shortly thereafter, the flood carried out its final assault when a large section of No. 3 mill broke loose and tumbled into the swift water.\n<br><br>\nThe current mill building on the hilltop (known as Converse Mill) was rebuilt soon after the flood - farther from the river - as were all of the factories and many mill houses downstream.<\/div>"},{"latlng":[34.003288,-81.037175],"options":{"title":"North Carolina Mutual Building"},"popup":"<h1>North Carolina Mutual Building<\/h1><strong>On Washington Street, Columbia, (On the right when traveling west)<\/strong><div><i>(Front text)<\/i><br>The North Carolina Mutual Building was built in 1909 by the N.C.

Ten years later, the settlers moved their town to its location here on the peninsula. By the 1690s there was a formal plan to enclose 62 acres of the settlement within a brick and earthen fortification to protect its residence from French, Spanish, and hostile Indians.<br>\nCharles Town's fortifications were completed by 1711. Bastions or small forts were named for Lord Proprietors Granville, Craven Colleton, and Carteret were constructed at each corner of the walled city. Three triangular redans were constructed in the wall along the Cooper River. A drawbridge guarded the land entrance at Meeting and Broad streets. The Half Moon Battery stood at the foot of Broad Street to provide a formal entrance to the town from the water. Charles Town was the only British walled city built in North America.<br><br>\n<b> Anatomy of the Walled City<\/b><br>\nThe engineering plans for the walls likely were based on European design principals for the fortifications. The seawall or curtain wall that fronted the Cooper River, as well as the bastions, redans and the Half Moon Battery, were built of hand-made bricks to protect the town against a sea assault. The seawall was six feet wide at the base and extended some 15 feet above the low tide line.<br>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Historians and archaeologists have found a few records that describe how the landward walls were constructed. They believe these fortifications were made by digging a ditch to create a moat and piling up the excavated earth to form walls that were strengthened with wood. They think these walls were eight to 10 feet high. <br><br><b>The Elusive City Wall<\/b><br>(Advertised sale inset) By the 1730s most of the earthen walls were demolished to accommodate the growing town. The harbor-side fortifications remain intact through the American Revolution. In 1784 the City advertised the bastions and redans for sale at public auction. The new owners demolished the aboveground portions of the fortifications and paved over them to make way for the expanding commercial waterfront.

Spanish voyages in 1514, 1521, 1525 and 1526 led to the lost Spanish City of San Miguel de Gualdape. In 1525, Spanish Captain Pedro de Quexos named the region Santa Elana, one of the oldest European place names in North America.<br>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1582, French Captain Jean Ribault arrived and renamed the sound Port Royal, the deepest natural harbor south of New York. On what is now Parris Island to the south, Ribault established the first protestant colony in the New World calling it Charlesfort. It was abandoned in 1563.<br>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1566, the Spanish returned, led by Pedro Menendez de Aviles who established La Cuidad de Santa Elana at the Charlesfort site and created the first official capital of Florida. The capital was moved to St. Augustine in 1574. Santa Elana was the northern bastion of Spanish Florida until it was abandoned in 1587.<br>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0English Captain William Hilton arrived from Barbados in 1663. Colonel Robert Sandford followed in 1666, leaving behind Dr. Henry Woodward who thus became the first permannent English settler in South Carolina.<br>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1685, Scottish settlers led by Lord Cardross established Stuart Town, up river from Charlesfort. It was destroyed by a Spanish Army in 1686. By 1698 the first English Land Grants were givrn to Scottish Indian \ntraders John Stewart and Thomas Nairne. Rivalry with Spanish Florida continued for the next 67 years.<br><br>\n<i>(Plaque 2)<\/i><br>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rivalry with Spanish Florida resulted in the founding of Beaufort. Queen Anne's war (1702-1713) prompted an attack by the Carolinians on St. Augustine in 1702 led by Colonel James Moore's army assembled at Port Royal Island. The attack on St. Augustine failed, but on their return they left an outpost here. By 1706, the Beaufort Outpost had become a log block house and palisade with a garrison of British Redcoats. The town grew around the fort with Indian trade in deerskins as the first commerce.<br>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1709, the traders petitioned the Lords Proprietors of Carolina to establish a town. On January 17, 1711, the charter for the town of Beaufort, then the second oldest town in South Carolina, was issued. \nIt was named for Henry Somerset, Duke of Beaufort, one of the Lords Proprietors. In 1717 Beaufort's streets were laid out and named. Town lots were granted at the time.<br>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two of the town's founders and first settlers were Captain Thomas Nairne and Colonel John \"Tuscarora Jack\" Barnwell.<br><br>\n<i>(Plaque 3)<\/i><br>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This early settlement was destroyed by the Yemassee Indians on April 15, 1715. The Yemassee War (1715-1728) depopulated the frontier and drove the Yemassee to Florida where they merged with the Seminoles. Thomas Nairne was killed in the first massacre. Colonel \"Tuscarora Jack\" Barnwell was one of the heroes of the war, which ended the Indian trade and Indian habitation of the lowcountry.<br>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Plantation Era followed the retreat of the Yemassee. Cattle thrived on the Sea Islands and on the mainland where an open range prompted branding of cattle and the development of \"cowpens\" in the pine forests.<br>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rice was introduced from West Africa in the 1730s and large plantations developed among the freshwater swamps and tidal creeks. In the 1740s, Indigo was introduced to the Sea Islands. This prompted the importation of tens of thousands of African slaves.<br>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Colonial wars with Spanish Florida and years of pirate raids slowed the growth of the town until the British acquired Florida in 1763.<br><br> \n<i>(Plaque 4)<\/i><br>\nThe decade before the Revolutionary War was a very prosperous time with cattle, rice, and indiago and \na thriving local ship building industry utilizing the abundant Live-Oak timber.<br>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Political strife with Great Britian prompted Royal Governor Charles Montague to move the capital from \nCharleston to Beaufort on October 8, 1772. His attempt to bully the King failed. The capital was moved back to Charleston after two days, prompting Thomas Heyward, Jr. to enter politics at the Beaufort assembly. He later signed the Declaration of Independence for South Carolina, and moving the Beaufort Assembly is listed as a grievance in the Declaration of Independence.<br>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beaufort was divided by the Revolutionary War. Friends, neighbors and relatives fought each other as \nTories and Patriots. British invasions in 1779 and 1780 halted commerce, destroyed property and \nkidnapped thousands of slaves. British General Augustine Provost's troops burned Prince William Parish Church in Sheldon in 1779. Colonel Banastre Tarleton's troops stole all the horses on Port Royal Island. When the Treaty of Paris recognized American Independence in 1783, Beaufort had to rebuild after eight years of war.<br><br>\n\n<i>(Plaque 5)<\/i><br>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Antebellum Era was known as the \"Periclean Age\" of Beaufort. Great wealth from Sea Island cotton and \"Carolina Gold\" rice made Beaufort one of the wealthiest towns in America. Large summer villas were built along Bay Street and throughout the old town. Beaufort College was chartered in 1795, the Beaufort Library Society was founded in 1803, and a female seminary was added in the 1850s. On December 17, 1803, the town of Beaufort was incorporated. The first municipal government was an intendant and six wardens. Beaufort produced political and intellectual leaders of the Old South, including Senator Robert W. Barnwell, poet William J. Grayson, and writer William Elliott, III.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1819, Beaufort was connected to the outside world by regular steamboat packets between Charleston and Savannah. President James Monroe visited in 1819, and the Marquis de Lafayette was entertained here in 1825. The wealth of antebellum Beaufort was based on the value and labor of slaves. In 1850, the Sea Islands had 1,111 white people and 8,361 slaves occupying 151 plantations.<br>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before the Civil War, Beaufort's planters were leading defenders of slavery and Southern rights. A Beaufort native, Senator Robert Barnwell Rhett, became South Carolina's \"Father of Secession.\" \nThis region led the state into secession, and South Carolina led the South out of the Union. The Civil War ensued.<br><br>\n<i>(Plaque 6)<\/i><br>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Civil War began in Charleston Harbor in April, 1861. Seven months later on November 7, 1861, a \nhuge Union fleet steamed into Port Royal Sound, subdued the Confederate forts on Hilton Head and Bay \nPoint, and occupied Beaufort and the Sea Islands. The Sea Islands remained in Union control throughout \nthe war. The wealthy planter families evacuated, leaving behind nearly 10,000 slaves.<br>\n In 1862, numerous religious and charitable groups came to Beaufort to educate the former slaves and \nprepare them for emancipation. Penn School, founded by Laura Towne on St. Helena Island in 1862, is \none of the oldest Freedmen Schools in America. These Philanthropic efforts were called \"The Port Royal \n\nExperiment.\" Beaufort became a headquarters and hospital community for the U.S. Army.<br>\n On January 1, 1863, President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation was issued and the Sea Island \nslaves became among the first freedmen in America. Thousands of African American soldiers were \nrecruited into the U.S. Army to fight for their own freedom. General William Tecumseh Sherman arrived in \nBeaufort in January, 1865. On April 26, 1865, the Civil War ended. By then, Beaufort and the Sea Islands \nhad become a colony of African American freedmen and northern merchants.<br>\n The Civil War totally transformed Beaufort. The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution \nended slavery, guaranteed civil rights, and gave the vote to the freedmen. Beaufort's African American \nmajority controlled politics for three decades. The political leader of Beaufort was Robert Smalls, former \nslave, Civil War hero, and five-term U.S. Congressman.<br>\n Reconstruction Beaufort was also transformed from a plantation economy to a commercial and \nindustrial economy. In 1873, the Port Royal and Augusta Railroad connected Port Royal Island to the \nmainland for the first time. The railroad delivered coal and Trans-Atlantic steamships frequented Port \nRoyal Sound. In 1877, the U.S. Navy established a coaling station and bought land on Parris Island.<br>\n Phosphate rock was discovered on the river bottoms and from 1870 to 1893, Beaufort County was the \nleading domestic source of phosphates, providing 3,000 local jobs. The commercial and industrial leader \nof reconstruction Beaufort was Duncan Campbell Wilson, a native of Greenock, Scotland.<br><br>\n<i>(Tablet 7)<\/i><br>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On August 27, 1893, one of the deadliest hurricanes in U.S. history struck Beaufort. Most of the Sea Islands were inundated. The phosphate works were completely destroyed. Nearly 2000 people were \ndrowned. The course of Beaufort's history was changed.<br>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The phosphate industry went into rapid decline and was gone by 1914. The Port Royal and Augusta Railroad went bankrupt and was merged with the Charleston and Western Carolina Line in 1896. The U.S. Navy abandoned their coaling station and dry dock in 1901. The maritime traffic slowed to a trickle, and the Port of Beaufort was officially closed in 1933.<br>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The cotton industry was unprofitable for fifteen years before World War I. In 1917, the Boll Weevil \nappeared in Beaufort County and by 1920, cotton was gone.

Taking advantage of British bounties for indigo, highly prized as a clothing dye in Europe, an elite class of indigo plantation owners and merchants evolved and formed the Winyah Indigo Society, which in 1755 established one of the first free schools in America. The Revolutionary War brought an end to the indigo trade with England and eventually indigo was replaced by rice. The turn of the twentieth century brought much needed prosperity to Georgetown. Lumber became a big industry in Georgetown in the late 1800's. By 1913, the Atlantic Coast Lumber Company, located in the bend of the Sampit River, was the largest lumber mill on the East Coast. In 1936, International Paper built a mill in Georgetown, which grew to be the largest paper mill in the world. In the late 1960's, the steel mill was built on the site of the Atlantic Coast Lumber Company. Both mills are still in operation. Georgetown County also is home to more than 100 other businesses and industries that manufacture everything from additives for the cosmetic industry to polyethylene liners for landfills.<\/div>"},{"latlng":[32.7903,-79.905773],"options":{"title":"Patriots Point Vietnam Memorial"},"popup":"<h1>Patriots Point Vietnam Memorial<\/h1><strong>Near Patriots Point Road, Mount Pleasant, (On the right when traveling south)<\/strong><div><>In Memorium To The Following Patriots<br>\nFrom The First Congressional District<br>\nOf The State of South Carolina<br>\nWho Valiantly Gave Their Lives On the Battlefields of Vietnam<br>\nDedicated May 9, 1981<br>\nThe American Legion Department of South Carolina<br>\nEdward T.

A 56-year-old planter, \"Grandpa\" Crawford owned 427 acres of land, had 13 children, and helped establish a school, a church, and farms in the local black community. During the Jim Crow era, successful black people were conspicuous - and arguing with whites was dangerous. That day, a white merchant demanded to buy Mr. Crawford's cottonseed for a lower price. Mr. Crawford, who used to tell his family he'd rather \"throw the seed in the Penny Creek,\" refused to sell. After an argument, Mr. Crawford was arrested. A few hours later, 300 white men seized him from jail and dragged him through town behind a buggy. Finally stopping at the fairgrounds, the mob stabbed, beat, hanged, and shot Mr. Crawford over 200 times - then forbade the Crawford family to remove his hanging body from the tree. Terrorized, the well-established, multi-generational Crawford family and many other local black people realized that Abbeville was not safe for them. Amid continued threats, most of the family scattered North, leaving behind what their patriarch had built, and carrying the painful loss of his wisdom and humor. A century later, this maker symbolizes their continued remembrance - and hope that Abbeville never forget or repeat that horrendous October day.\n<br><br>\n<b><>Racial Violence in South Carolina<><\/b>\nBefore the Civil War, South Carolina relied on a plantation economy and enslaved Africans outnumbered white residents. Dehumanized, brutalized, and treated as property, black people resisted in ways small and large to survive. After the Confederacy's defeat, the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution ended slavery and guaranteed black citizenship rights. Reconstruction promised federal enforcement and gave African Americans hope for the future. Black men used their new voting rights and, in South Carolina, elected African-American candidates to all levels of government. African Americans' political and economic advancement soon sparked resentment and violence. When federal protection ended in 1877, lynching - or murder at the hands of a mob - became a tool for re-establishing white supremacy and terrorizing the black community. White mobs lynched more than 4000 black people in the south between 1877 and 1950, and more than 180 of them were killed in South Carolina. In addition to Anthony Crawford in 1916, at least seven other men were lynched in Abbeville County during the era: Dave Roberts (1882); James Mason (1894); Thomas Watts and John Richards (1895); Allen Pendleton (1905); Will Lozier (1915); and Mark Smith (1919).<\/div>"},{"latlng":[33.667731,-78.939556],"options":{"title":"Myrtle Beach Air Force Base"},"popup":"<h1>Myrtle Beach Air Force Base<\/h1><strong>On Hackler Street, Myrtle Beach, (On the left when traveling east)<\/strong><div><br> To commemorate the history of the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base and the people who were a part of it, the City of Myrtle Beach and the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base Redevelopment Authority erected a signage program to capture and display the history.

As a World War II commander of the XIX Tactical Air Command and of the 9th Air Force, I had ample opportunity to judge the fighting qualities of the assigned units, and considered the 354th Fighter Group of World War II fame to be the finest day-fighter outfit in existence.<br><br>With the precipitous demobilization following the war, the 354th designation was lost to the Regular Air Force for some years, and many of our air leaders, including General Timberlake and Colonel Gabreski, felt our new fighter wing here at Myrtle Beach deserved to inherit the history, battle streamers and traditions of the old 354th.<br><br>I would like to review briefly just a little of the history of this unit, that you may better appreciate the past combat record and proud traditions of the fighter wing which is now to be based at Myrtle Beach.<br><br>The 354th Group was originally activated November 15, 1942, in California, and less than a year later was sent to England as the first combat outfit to be equipped with the North American P-51 Mustang &#8212; the finest air to-air fighter of World War II. They were subsequently called the \"Pioneer Mustang Group &#8212; and \"pioneers\" they were in many ways. From their original permanent Regular Air Force station in East Anglia, they moved to an advanced landing field in Kent, England, with tents for technical supplies, messes and living quarters. They were one of the first outfits to move on to the Normandy Beachhead area, and from there to the end of the war, they seldom stayed on an air strip more than two or three weeks as the XIX Tactical Air Command - Third Army team swept through France, Luxembourg and Germany.<br><br> The 354th rapidly established a reputation and combat record for other fighter groups to shoot at. I visited the outfit frequently and know that the record established was not a matter of luck. They were an inspired group of professionals. Every mission was painstakingly planned. Following every combat mission, every action and reaction of the enemy air force was meticulously analyzed, and their own combat tactics modified accordingly. The results speak for themselves. The 354th flew 1,384 missions of 18,334 sorties, during which 966 enemy planes were destroyed, and 701 of these were destroyed in air-to-air combat and 265 were destroyed on the ground.<br><br> Additionally, the group performed many missions in support of General Patton's Third Army, and many enemy ground troops, tanks, vehicles and stores of supplies were destroyed.<br><br> That combat was not without cost &#8212; 187 pilots and many aircraft of the 354th were lost in combat. Many paid the supreme sacrifice &#8211; some became prisoners of war and later returned safely.<br><br>A good fighting outfit is made up of good airplanes, manned and maintained by good men, and led by good leaders. We are honored to have the World War II Group Commanders here today, and I would like to tell you just a little about these men, that you may sense a little better the character and traditions of the outfit they led so well.<br><br> The original commander activated, organized and trained the 354th in this country and led it in combat in the early days when we escorted the heavy bombers to their military targets deep in Germany. The opposing German Air Force, in those days, was strong, cunning and tough - but so was the leader of the 354th. He was a regular officer, a professional, and trained the group carefully and skillfully. He led them himself and soon was an ace with six Germans to his credit. He always carried his attacks through relentlessly and stubbornly, with the result his opponent would usually try to break off first. One day he met a German who was equally stubborn and didn't break off from the attack. There was a head on collision - two locked aircraft spun together down through the overcast. Both pilots, though critically injured, wound up in the same hospital and lived. That man is with us today. Being a regular, he returned to active service after getting out of prison camp, but his injuries finally forced his retirement for physical disability. He is a great officer and leader and a fine gentleman. I would like to introduce him to you - Colonel Kenneth R. Martin.<br><br>\n<i>( adjacent marker )<\/i><br>\n<b><>Reactivation of 354th Fighter Day Wing<><\/b>\n<>Address by<br>General O.P.

This man had previously fought against the Japanese and had become an ace in the Far East. Being a \"tiger\" he didn't rest on his laurels, but had volunteered for a second combat tour in Europe. He was a great fighter and air leader and ably carried on \"Sleeper\" Martin's traditions. One escort mission which he led deep inside Germany exemplifies his character. The 354th which he was leading had protected the heavies over the target. A relief fighter would be lost over enemy territory for lack of fuel. Shortly after the 354th reluctantly broke off escort, the fighters closed in on the heavy bomber formation and the heavies yelled for help. This 354th Commander, as the leader and most experienced pilot, had conserved his fuel a little better than the other flight members. He ordered the main fighter group on home to save it, and then turned around to rescue the heavy bombers. Single-handedly, he disrupted the German fighter attack, shooting down five aircraft. Having saved the American bombers, he then headed back and glided to a landing on the English coast with empty fuel tanks. He didn't have much to say about the mission, but Flying Fortress crews did. They said, \"It was a case of one, lone American taking on the entire Luftwaffe. This \"one man air force\" was subsequently awarded America's highest decoration for valor the Congressional Medal of Honor, and I think you will agree it was highly deserved. May I present Brigadier General Jim Howard.\nOver his bitter protests, Jim Howard was moved up to higher staff duty with the 9th Fighter Command Headquarter. Colonel George Bickell, squadron commander and one of the old original hands in the 359th, moved up to replace Howard as group commander.\nThe 354th was on the continent, moving from one new advanced landing strip to another. Their combat skill became uncanny - they seemed to know what the Germans were going to do before the Germans knew it. It seemed as though they could smell them - I should know.\nOne day I was stooging around by myself in a P-51 when I heard RIPSAW Control announce a bogey in the area. I armed my guns, put on more power and started taking on altitude thinking maybe the old man might get himself an enemy airplane. All of a sudden I found myself boxed in by a bunch of 354th Mustangs: apparently I was the bogey. I think George Bickell was a little disgusted with me, but led the 354th through to the end and probably bailed me out of trouble more than once. Proved in combat, a ace with victories, he is now in Headquarters, United States Air Force, and champing at the bit to get another combat command. I'd like to present to you: George Bickell.\nI think that will give you an insight into the traditions and spirt of the old 354th.

Some of you from the community may remember when construction started at this base back in 1941, and I know most of you are familiar with the \"new look\" the base has taken on since it has been reopened under TAC and the 9th Air Force. Tactical Air Command is proud to regain a \"proven\" station along with a \"proven\" unit. The wing here at Myrtle Beach is to operate one of the latest supersonic series of aircraft that the Air Force has in operation today &#8212; the F-100D. These are fast, powerful aircraft and make some noise &#8212; but this noise is significant as the sound of progress and the sound of peace. We who hear these aircraft are fortunate &#8212; we live in a land of safety and plenty. These aircraft represent not only protection for our homes but for our very way of life. It is a comforting thought to remember.<br><br>I feel this aircraft deserves a little special recognition being the first supersonic aircraft and the first of the \"Century Series\" in the Air Force. Aircraft like these don't just happen they are the result of long foresight of Air Force planners and the skilled ability of aviation and industrial research engineers and manufacturers. North American may well be proud of its accomplishments and Pratt and Whitney can be equally proud of the J-57 engine with which the F-100 is powered. Both are a tribute to American technology and ingenuity.<br><br>We are about to mix these ingredients &#8212; a unit with an outstanding record, an outstanding airplane, a fine air base, a community that has displayed outstanding cooperation and hospitality to the officers and airmen selected to man this unit, and, most important, military leadership of outstanding quality, for Colonel Grabreski, new commander of the 354th, is one of the best known of the old professional fighter hands. He was an outstanding ace in World War II and became a jet ace while under me during the Korean War. With these ingredients, we can't go wrong.<br><br>Gabby, I congratulate you on this magnificent command and wish you success in your task ahead.

Since the maintenance and operation of an airport is a year-round proposition, it was easy to see that the town had embarked upon a big venture.<br><br>When the officials took over the former base, which had cost the Government $5,000,000, Mayor H.W. Tallevast appointed a five-man commission to negotiate with the War Assets Administration for the property, to hire an airport manager, and to take all steps necessary to develop an undertaking where the non-aviation revenue would offset the deficit in the airport operations. The Commission then charged the Airport Manager, E.A. Anthony, with making the Myrtle Beach Airport self-supporting. He adopted a short range program to raise money for the immediate operation and also a long range one to put the airport ultimately on a self-sustaining basis.<br><br> The Airport Commission began looking at the basic layout map of the installation, blocked into areas, marking those which were to be developed according to their highest and best use. One section of the airfield, originally used for housing troops, was in the southwest corner of the airfield, adjoining several thousand acres of woodland. Soon occupying this tract were three turkey farms, raising approximately 50,000 birds per year. This venture started with skepticism because it was feared that airplanes flying at low altitudes would cause the turkeys to stampede. On the contrary, the turkeys soon became accustomed to aircraft and paid little attention to them. <br> <br> \n<i>( photo caption )<\/i><br> \nA scene on one of three turkey farms, showing a few of the 50,000 birds raised annually on land which once quartered troopd during the war.

Officials of the Cleveland Indians and the Boston Braves made personal inspections of the facilities. After a few months of negotiations, a contract was signed with the Boston Braves to make the airport the training base for the entire farm system. <br><br>Many baseball officials who visited the site claimed that it was the best and most practical training camp they had examined. A training field was laid out in one large square which was 900 feet on each side. A tower 20 feet high was constructed in the middle of the square. Four ball fields pointed out from the tower. Baseball managers and coaches could sit in the tower and watch four complete ball games in progress simultaneously. <br><br>\n<i>( photo caption )<\/i><br>\nPart of the airport served as a spring training base for the entire Boston Braves farm system.

In addition, there was a shower and laundry room which had ample hot and cold water all year 'round. <br><br>The Airport Commission was also successful in recruiting small industries to utilize many of the buildings at the airport.

Many chose ferocious or protective names to ward off bad luck or to strike terror in the heart of the enemy.<br><br> Inspiration for nose art came from a wide range of sources including the most popular being an image of a woman, music, movies, alma maters, sports, comic strip characters, good luck symbols, the grim reaper, the unit's mission and locale and history of the particular aircraft.<br><br>Nose art is regarded as a form of folk art because it was an individual icon that was nonofficial and sometimes non approved &#8212; sponsored and undertaken by the combat crews. <br><br>Nose art is essentially a wartime phenomenon. When WWII ended so did nose art temporarily. Five years later, the character of nose art changed somewhat. Unlike WWII, the Korean War nose a did not focus on defeating evil. The country was focused on defeating communism in a distant foreign land. Nose art representing the mission, home, good luck and women continued.<br><br>Nose art re-emerged during the Vietnam War. While the war spanned the period from 1965 to 1973, nose art had a shorter life span from 1967 to 1970. Stricter regulations were now in place. The units had less planes ruling out the possibility of one pilot to a single plane. An exception was the 355th division where pilots were assigned aircraft and excellent nose art, maintenance and morale were evident. There were some changes, however, as a result of changing attitudes in American society. The personal commitment to the country cause was often absent and reflected in the art. New themes appeared such as peace, and more often the art avoided the subject of the war altogether with cartoon characters, music, television and movies as subject matter. Female nudes were replaced with rock music which reflected the changing attitude about women in society. The average age of pilots during the Vietnam War was 32 years and most were interested in naming their planes after their wives, children, or girlfriends. <br><br>After Vietnam, there was a long break in the creation of nose art because restrictions were enforced during peacetime. In the early 1980s through 1991 nose art became popular again, beginning with a few selected units, and expanding to all types of aircraft i the Air Force. (Printed with permission from the University of Arizona, Military Aircraft Nose Art: An American Tradition\" parentseyes.arizona.edu\/militarynoseant.) <br><br>Nose art was very popular with the A-10 pilots from Myrtle Beach Air Force Base during the first Gulf War. Lt Col Mike McGee, USAF (Ret) while deployed to King Fahd International Airport in the months leading up to Desert Storm took it upon himself one very hot day to paint the name of the squadron commander beneath the canopy rail hoping that he would like it and want then 1st Lt McGee to do all the jets and then may be let him do some nose art. It was starting to look nice after about a half hour but then out and exhausted from the heat, 1st Lt McGee had to call it a day and he had only half finished the lettering. Back in the squadron building, he pounded down some water and took a nap on the cot set up next to the phones. Suddenly he heard the 354th Wing maintenance on the radio wanting to know who had painted a half finished name on the canopy rail of jet #158. When the squadron maintenance officer finally caught up with him he confessed. Before long, the rest of the unit's pilots started filtering into the squadron to prepare for the night's training sorties. McGee tried to escape before the boss showed up, but was told by his ops officer, Lt Col \"Woozy\" Barton, not to pass go and report directly to Falcon 1. McGee then reported to Lt Col McDow who explained he did not much need his name painted on the plane but asked McGee if he could paint some nose art, a big Warthog face with a smoking gatling gun sticking out of it's mouth. So he painted that one and took the liberty of honoring the boss a bit by stenciling \"Falcon 1\" above the gun chomping Warthog.<\/div>"},{"latlng":[33.661188,-78.928685],"options":{"title":"Grand Strand Chapter and Unit 354"},"popup":"<h1>Grand Strand Chapter and Unit 354<\/h1><strong>On Farrow Parkway, Myrtle Beach, (On the right when traveling north)<\/strong><div><br>On August 7, 1782, the Badge of Military Merit was first announced to the Continental Army at the Headquarters in Newburgh, NY.
